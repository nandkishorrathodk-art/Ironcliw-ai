## 🎯 Phase 1: Foundation Enhancements (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Multi-Monitor Support ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Current Gap:** Assumes single display
**Enhancement:** Support multiple monitors with independent spaces

**Implementation:**
```python
# backend/vision/multi_monitor_detector.py (NEW)

class MultiMonitorDetector:
    """Detect and track windows across multiple displays"""
    
    async def detect_displays(self) -> List[Display]:
        """
        Detect all connected displays using Core Graphics.
        Returns display ID, resolution, position, active spaces.
        """
        displays = Quartz.CGGetActiveDisplayList(32, None, None)
        return [self._get_display_info(display_id) for display_id in displays]
    
    async def get_space_display_mapping(self) -> Dict[int, int]:
        """Map each space to its display ID"""
        # Use Yabai + CG to determine which display each space is on
        pass
    
    async def capture_all_displays(self) -> Dict[int, Dict[int, np.ndarray]]:
        """
        Returns: {display_id: {space_id: screenshot}}
        """
        pass
```

**Enhancement Points:**
- Detect monitor arrangement (primary, secondary, vertical stack, etc.)
- Track which spaces are on which monitors
- Capture screenshots per-display
- Provide display-aware analysis: "Your primary monitor is focused on development, secondary on documentation"

**User Queries Enabled:**
- "What's on my second monitor?"
- "Show me all my displays"
- "What am I doing on monitor 2?"

**Files to Modify:**
- `backend/vision/multi_monitor_detector.py` (NEW)
- `backend/vision/intelligent_orchestrator.py` (enhance workspace scouting)
- `backend/vision/yabai_space_detector.py` (add display detection)

---

### 1.2 Temporal Analysis & Video Intelligence ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Current Gap:** Static screenshots only, no time-based analysis
**Enhancement:** Track changes over time, detect patterns, analyze workflows

**Implementation:**
```python
# backend/vision/temporal_analyzer.py (NEW)

class TemporalAnalyzer:
    """Analyze visual changes over time"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.screenshot_history = deque(maxlen=100)  # Last 100 captures
        self.change_detector = ChangeDetector()
        self.pattern_analyzer = PatternAnalyzer()
    
    async def detect_changes(
        self, 
        current_screenshot: np.ndarray,
        previous_screenshot: np.ndarray
    ) -> ChangeReport:
        """
        Detect visual changes between screenshots:
        - New errors appeared
        - Terminal output changed
        - Code was modified
        - Browser navigated to new page
        """
        diff = cv2.absdiff(current_screenshot, previous_screenshot)
        changed_regions = self._identify_changed_regions(diff)
        
        return ChangeReport(
            changed_regions=changed_regions,
            change_magnitude=np.sum(diff) / diff.size,
            change_type=self._classify_change(changed_regions),
            significant_changes=self._extract_significant_changes(changed_regions)
        )
    
    async def analyze_workflow_session(
        self, 
        duration_minutes: int = 30
    ) -> WorkflowReport:
        """
        Analyze user's workflow over a time period:
        - How long in each space
        - How many context switches
        - What was accomplished

        """
        pass
    
    async def detect_stuck_state(self) -> Optional[StuckState]:
        """
        Detect if user is stuck:
        - Same error visible for >5 minutes
        - No code changes in editor for >10 minutes
        - Multiple failed test runs
        - Repeatedly googling same error
        """
        pass
```

**Enhancement Points:**
- **Change Detection:** Detect when errors appear/disappear, code changes, terminal output updates
- **Session Analysis:** Track what user accomplished in last hour/day
- **Stuck Detection:** Proactively offer help if user seems stuck on same error
- **Workflow Patterns:** Learn user's typical workflow (coding → testing → debugging cycle)
- **Video Recording:** Record workspace activity for later review

**User Queries Enabled:**
- "What changed in the last 5 minutes?"
- "When did this error first appear?"
- "Am I making progress?"
- "How long have I been stuck on this?"
- "Show me my workflow today"

### 1.3 Proactive Error Detection ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Current Gap:** Reactive (user must ask)
**Enhancement:** Proactive alerts when errors detected

**Implementation:**
```python
# backend/vision/proactive_monitor.py (ENHANCE)

class ProactiveMonitor:
    """Monitor workspace and proactively alert on issues"""
    
    async def continuous_monitoring_loop(self):
        """
        Continuously monitor workspace (every 10-30 seconds):
        1. Capture current state
        2. Detect changes
        3. Analyze for issues
        4. Alert if critical
        """
        while self.monitoring_active:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.check_interval)
            
            # Capture current state
            current_state = await self._capture_workspace_state()
            
            # Detect issues
            issues = await self._detect_issues(current_state)
            
            # Alert on critical issues
            for issue in issues:
                if issue.severity == Severity.CRITICAL:
                    await self._send_proactive_alert(issue)
    
    async def _detect_issues(self, state: WorkspaceState) -> List[Issue]:
        """
        Detect various issues:
        - New errors in IDE Problems panel
        - Terminal errors/failures
        - Browser console errors
        - Long-running processes stuck
        - Resource usage spikes
        """
        issues = []
        
        # Check for new errors
        if self._has_new_errors(state):
            issues.append(Issue(
                type=IssueType.NEW_ERROR,
                severity=Severity.HIGH,
                message="Sir, a new error just appeared in your editor",
                details=self._extract_error_details(state),
                suggested_action="Would you like me to analyze it?"
            ))
        
        # Check for build failures
        if self._detected_build_failure(state):
            issues.append(Issue(
                type=IssueType.BUILD_FAILURE,
                severity=Severity.CRITICAL,
                message="Sir, your build just failed",
                details=self._extract_build_error(state)
            ))
        
        # Check for stuck processes
        if self._detected_stuck_process(state):
            issues.append(Issue(

                details=self._identify_stuck_process(state)
            ))
        
        return issues
```

**Enhancement Points:**
- **Real-time monitoring:** Check workspace every 10-30 seconds
- **Smart alerting:** Only alert on significant changes (not every keystroke)
- **Contextual alerts:** "Sir, you've been looking at this error for 10 minutes. Would you like suggestions?"
- **Build monitoring:** Detect when builds fail, tests fail, deployments error
- **Performance alerts:** Detect high CPU/memory usage, slow processes

**User Experience:**
```
[Ironcliw, unprompted]: "Sir, a new error just appeared in Space 3, line 422."

User: "What is it?"

Ironcliw: "Type error: 'str' cannot be assigned to 'int'. 
This is likely from your recent change on line 415."
```

**Files to Enhance:**
- `backend/vision/proactive_monitor.py` (ENHANCE existing)
- `backend/api/vision_command_handler.py` (add alert delivery)

---

### 1.4 Smart Caching & Performance Optimization ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Current Gap:** Captures all screenshots fresh each time
**Enhancement:** Cache screenshots, detect changes, only re-analyze what changed

**Implementation:**
```python
# backend/vision/smart_cache.py (NEW)

class SmartCache:
    """Intelligent caching for screenshots and analysis"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.screenshot_cache = {}  # {space_id: (screenshot, hash, timestamp)}

        self.change_threshold = 0.05  # 5% change = re-capture
    
    async def get_or_capture(
        self, 
        space_id: int, 
        force: bool = False
    ) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, bool]:
        """
        Returns: (screenshot, is_cached)
        
        Logic:
        1. If cached and recent (<30s) → return cache
        2. If cached but old → capture new, check if changed
        3. If changed > threshold → update cache
        4. If changed < threshold → return old cache (minor changes)
        """
        cached = self.screenshot_cache.get(space_id)
        
        if not force and cached:
            age = time.time() - cached['timestamp']
            if age < 30:  # Fresh enough
                return cached['screenshot'], True
        
        # Capture new screenshot
        new_screenshot = await self._capture_space(space_id)
        new_hash = self._hash_image(new_screenshot)
        
        # Check if significantly changed
        if cached:
            old_hash = cached['hash']
            similarity = self._compute_similarity(new_screenshot, cached['screenshot'])
            
            if similarity > (1 - self.change_threshold):
                # Minor change, return cached
                return cached['screenshot'], True
        
        # Update cache
        self.screenshot_cache[space_id] = {
            'screenshot': new_screenshot,
            'hash': new_hash,
            'timestamp': time.time()
        }
        
        return new_screenshot, False
    
    async def get_or_analyze(
        self, 
        screenshot: np.ndarray, 
        prompt: str
    ) -> str:
        """
        Check if we've analyzed this exact screenshot before.
        If yes, return cached Claude response (save API call).
        """
        image_hash = self._hash_image(screenshot)
        
        if image_hash in self.analysis_cache:
            return self.analysis_cache[image_hash]
        
        # New analysis needed
        response = await self.claude_analyzer.analyze(screenshot, prompt)
        self.analysis_cache[image_hash] = response
        
        return response
```

**Enhancement Points:**
- **Screenshot diffing:** Only re-capture if significant change detected
- **Analysis caching:** Cache Claude responses for identical screenshots
- **Selective capture:** Only capture spaces that changed
- **Compression:** Compress cached screenshots (JPEG with 85% quality)
- **TTL management:** Auto-expire old cache entries

**Performance Impact:**
- **Before:** Every query = 5 space captures + 5 Claude API calls
- **After:** Every query = 1-2 captures + 0-2 Claude API calls
- **Speed improvement:** 3-5x faster
- **Cost reduction:** 60-80% fewer API calls

### 1.5 Robust Error Handling & Fallbacks ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Current Gap:** Some edge cases may cause failures
**Enhancement:** Graceful degradation, comprehensive error handling

**Implementation:**
```python
# backend/vision/resilient_capture.py (NEW)

class ResilientCapture:
    """Robust capture with multiple fallback strategies"""
    
    async def capture_with_fallbacks(
        self,

        """
        Try multiple strategies to capture a space:
        1. CG Windows API (primary)
        2. screencapture CLI (fallback 1)

        4. Full screen capture (fallback 3)
        """
        strategies = [
            self._capture_with_cg_windows,
            self._capture_with_screencapture_cli,

            self._capture_full_screen
        ]
        
        for strategy in strategies:
            try:
                result = await strategy(space_id)
                if result.success:
                    return result
            except Exception as e:
                logger.warning(f"Capture strategy {strategy.__name__} failed: {e}")

        return CaptureResult(
            success=False,
            error="All capture strategies failed"
        )
    
    async def _capture_with_screencapture_cli(
        self, 
        space_id: int
    ) -> CaptureResult:
        """
        Fallback: Use macOS screencapture CLI.
        Requires switching to the space (disruptive but reliable).
        """
        # Switch to space
        await self._switch_to_space(space_id)
        
        # Capture with CLI
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["screencapture", "-x", "-o", "/tmp/jarvis_capture.png"],
            capture_output=True
        )
        
        if result.returncode == 0:
            image = Image.open("/tmp/jarvis_capture.png")
            return CaptureResult(
                success=True,

                method_used="screencapture_cli"
            )
```

**Edge Cases to Handle:**

1. **Space doesn't exist:** User asks about Space 10, but only 6 exist
   - Response: "Sir, I only detect 6 desktop spaces. Space 10 doesn't exist."

2. **Empty space:** Space has no windows
   - Response: "Sir, Space 3 appears to be empty."

3. **Permission denied:** Screen recording permission not granted
   - Response: "Sir, I need screen recording permissions. Please enable in System Settings."

4. **Yabai not running:** Yabai service is stopped
   - Fallback to CG Windows only
   - Notify: "Sir, Yabai service appears to be down. Functionality will be limited."

5. **Claude API rate limit:** Hit API rate limits
   - Use cached responses
   - Notify: "Sir, API rate limit reached. Using cached analysis."

6. **Network failure:** No internet connection
   - Use local analysis (metadata only)
   - Notify: "Sir, no internet connection. Using local analysis only."

7. **Fullscreen app:** App in fullscreen mode (harder to capture)
   - Use alternative capture method
   - May need to temporarily exit fullscreen

8. **Window minimized:** User asks about minimized window
   - Restore window briefly to capture
   - Notify: "Sir, I had to temporarily restore the window to capture it."

**User Experience:**
```
User: "What does this function do?"

Ironcliw: "Sir, this function (_select_capture_targets) dynamically 
selects which windows to capture based on:
1. Query intent (error analysis, debugging, research)
2. Window priorities (terminals and IDEs score higher)
3. Visual change detection (only capture if changed)

It returns a prioritized list of CaptureTarget objects, limited by 
the max_targets configuration."

User: "Why am I getting this TypeError?"

Ironcliw: "Sir, on line 421, you're passing a variable 'result' of type 
Optional[str] to a function expecting type int. This is happening 
because the upstream function on line 385 can return None, but you're 
not checking for that case before passing it forward.

Fix: Add a null check before line 421:
    if result is not None:
        process_value(int(result))
"
```

## 🎛️ Edge Cases & Robustness

### Edge Case Handling Matrix

| Edge Case | Current Behavior | Enhanced Behavior |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Space doesn't exist** | Error | "Sir, only 6 spaces exist. Space 10 not found." |
| **Empty space** | Generic message | "Sir, Space 3 is empty. No windows detected." |
| **Minimized window** | Can't capture | Restore briefly, capture, re-minimize |
| **Fullscreen app** | Partial capture | Use alternative capture method |
| **Permission denied** | Generic error | "Sir, please enable screen recording in System Settings." |
| **Yabai not running** | Fallback to CG | Notify user, offer to start Yabai |
| **Claude API down** | Error | Use cached responses, local analysis |
| **Rate limited** | Error | Use cache, notify user, suggest retry time |
| **Network down** | Error | Switch to offline mode (metadata only) |
| **Multiple monitors** | Only primary | Detect all monitors, analyze each |
| **Monitor arrangement changed** | Confusion | Auto-detect new arrangement |
| **Very slow screenshot** | Timeout | Progress indicator, cancel option |
| **Very large codebase** | Slow analysis | Index codebase once, use fast search |
| **Binary files in screenshot** | OCR failure | Detect binary, skip OCR, identify file type |
| **Non-English text** | OCR issues | Multi-language OCR support |
| **High resolution display** | Large images | Smart compression, region-based capture |
| **Rapid space switching** | Confusion | Debounce, wait for stable state |

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Current Performance Profile
- **Overview query:** ~0.2s (Yabai metadata only)
- **Single space analysis:** ~3-5s (Yabai + CG Windows + Claude)
- **Multi-space analysis:** ~10-15s (multiple Claude API calls)

### Target Performance (Phase 1-2)
- **Overview query:** ~0.1s (optimized Yabai)
- **Single space analysis:** ~1-2s (caching + compression)
- **Multi-space analysis:** ~3-5s (parallel processing + selective capture)

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Screenshot Caching** (5x speedup)
   - Cache screenshots for 30 seconds
   - Use image diffing to detect changes
   - Only re-capture if changed > 5%

2. **Parallel Processing** (3x speedup)
   - Capture multiple spaces in parallel
   - Process screenshots concurrently
   - Batch Claude API calls

3. **Selective Capture** (60% cost reduction)
   - Only capture spaces mentioned in query
   - Only capture windows that changed
   - Skip unchanged content

4. **Response Caching** (API cost reduction)
   - Cache Claude responses by image hash
   - Reuse responses for identical screenshots
   - TTL: 5 minutes

5. **Compression** (2x bandwidth reduction)
   - JPEG compression at 85% quality
   - Resize large images (max 1920x1080)
   - Use WebP for better compression

6. **Incremental Analysis** (streaming responses)
   - Stream Claude responses as they arrive
   - Show partial results immediately
   - Progressive enhancement

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### Privacy Considerations

1. **Local Processing:** All screenshots processed locally first
2. **Opt-in Cloud:** Claude API only used with explicit permission
3. **Data Retention:** Screenshots deleted after analysis (not stored)
4. **Encryption:** Sensitive data encrypted in memory
5. **User Control:** User can disable vision at any time

### Security Measures

1. **Permission Checks:** Verify screen recording permission
2. **API Key Security:** Encrypt API keys, never log them
3. **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user inputs
4. **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse with rate limits
5. **Audit Logging:** Log all Ironcliw actions for review
