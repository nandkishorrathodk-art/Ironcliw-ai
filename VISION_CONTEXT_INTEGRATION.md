# Vision + Context Intelligence Integration

## Overview

The **Vision Intelligence** and **Context Intelligence** systems now work **together** to provide comprehensive, accurate responses by combining:

1. **Visual Analysis** (PureVisionIntelligence) - What Claude sees on screen
2. **Structured Context** (Context Intelligence Bridge) - Terminal commands, errors, app state
3. **Unified Response** (AsyncPipeline) - Orchestrates both systems

## How It Works

### Before Integration

**User:** "can you see my terminal in the other window?"

**Ironcliw (Vision Only):**
```
Based on the workspace information and visual access across all desktops,
I can see that Desktop 2 has a Terminal window available...
```

❌ **Problem:** Only uses visual analysis, no structured context about terminal state

### After Integration

**User:** "can you see my terminal in the other window?"

**Ironcliw (Vision + Context):**
```
Yes, I can see Terminal in Space 2, Sir. I notice there's an error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'

This happened when you ran: `python app.py`

Would you like me to explain what's happening in detail?
```

✅ **Solution:** Combines visual + structured context for accurate, actionable responses

## Architecture

```
User Query: "can you see my terminal?"
    ↓
AsyncPipeline (orchestrator)
    ↓
    ├─→ Context Intelligence Bridge
    │   ├─ MultiSpaceContextGraph (structured data)
    │   ├─ Terminal errors, commands, working dir
    │   ├─ Cross-space relationships
    │   └─ Returns: Structured context
    │
    └─→ PureVisionIntelligence
        ├─ Claude Vision API (visual analysis)
        ├─ Screenshot analysis
        ├─ Receives structured context from bridge
        └─ Combines both for comprehensive response
```

## Integration Points

### 1. PureVisionIntelligence Enhanced

**File:** `backend/api/pure_vision_intelligence.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `context_bridge` parameter to `__init__`
- Added `_get_structured_context()` method
- Enhanced `_build_pure_intelligence_prompt()` to include structured context
- Claude now receives workspace intelligence in its prompt

**Example Context Provided to Claude:**
```
═══ WORKSPACE INTELLIGENCE (from Context System) ═══

🔴 DETECTED ERRORS:
  • Terminal (Space 2): ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
    Command: python app.py

💻 RECENT TERMINAL ACTIVITY:
  • Space 2: `python app.py` in /Users/project

📱 ACTIVE APPLICATIONS (3 windows):
  • Terminal (Space 2): terminal
  • Chrome (Space 1): browser
  • VS Code (Space 3): ide

Use this context to enhance your visual analysis!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 2. Context Intelligence Provides Data

**File:** `backend/core/context/context_integration_bridge.py`

**What It Provides:**
- Terminal errors and commands (from TerminalCommandIntelligence)
- Working directories
- Cross-space application tracking
- Recent activity significance
- Semantic relationships

### 3. Main.py Connection

**File:** `backend/main.py` (line 685)

```python
# Connect Vision Intelligence to Context Bridge
if hasattr(vision_command_handler, 'vision_intelligence'):
    vision_command_handler.vision_intelligence.context_bridge = bridge
```

**Flow:**
1. Context Bridge initialized first
2. Vision Intelligence receives bridge reference
3. Every query combines both data sources

## Benefits

### 1. Accurate Error Detection
- **Before:** "I can see a Terminal window"
- **After:** "I can see Terminal in Space 2 with error: ModuleNotFoundError"

### 2. Proactive Assistance
- Detects errors before user asks
- Offers detailed explanations
- Suggests fixes via TerminalCommandIntelligence

### 3. Cross-Space Awareness
- Tracks terminal activity across all desktops
- Correlates errors with research in browser
- Understands multi-space workflows

### 4. Structured + Visual
- Structured: Exact command, error text, working directory
- Visual: What user is actually seeing on screen
- Combined: Complete understanding

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Terminal Error

**Context Intelligence Detects:**
- Terminal (Space 2)
- Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'`
- Command: `python app.py`
- Directory: `/Users/project`

**Vision Intelligence Sees:**
- Terminal window with error text
- User on Desktop 1 (different from Terminal)

**Combined Response:**
```
Yes, I can see Terminal in Space 2, Sir. I notice there's an error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'

This happened when you ran: `python app.py`

Would you like me to explain what's happening in detail?
```

**Follow-Up Support:**
```
User: "explain in detail"

Ironcliw: **Terminal (Space 2)**
Working directory: `/Users/project`

Last command: `python app.py`

**Error Analysis:**
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'

**Suggested Fix:**
1. `pip install requests`
   Purpose: Install missing Python module 'requests'
   Safety: YELLOW
   Impact: Installs Python package 'requests'
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-Space Workflow

**Context Intelligence Tracks:**
- Terminal (Space 1): Running tests
- Browser (Space 2): Stack Overflow research
- VS Code (Space 3): Editing code

**Vision Intelligence Sees:**
- User currently viewing Browser

**Combined Response:**
```
I can see you're researching on Stack Overflow in Space 2, Sir.
I also notice Terminal in Space 1 is showing test failures,
and you have the related code open in VS Code (Space 3).

Would you like me to correlate the error with your research?
```

## Technical Details

### Structured Context Format

```python
{
    "total_spaces": 3,
    "active_spaces": [1, 2, 3],
    "applications": {
        "Terminal (Space 2)": {
            "type": "terminal",
            "last_activity": "2025-10-10T17:42:21",
            "significance": "critical"
        }
    },
    "errors": [
        {
            "space": 2,
            "app": "Terminal",
            "error": "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'",
            "command": "python app.py"
        }
    ],
    "recent_commands": [
        {
            "space": 2,
            "app": "Terminal",
            "command": "python app.py",
            "directory": "/Users/project"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Integration Method

```python
async def _get_structured_context(self, user_query: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get structured context from Context Intelligence Bridge"""
    if not self.context_bridge:
        return None

    # Get comprehensive workspace summary
    summary = self.context_bridge.context_graph.get_summary()

    # Extract terminal errors, commands, apps
    # Build structured context dict
    # Return for Claude's prompt
```

### Prompt Enhancement

Claude receives:
1. **User query**
2. **Conversation history**
3. **Temporal context**
4. **Structured workspace intelligence** (NEW!)
5. **Visual screenshot**

Result: Complete understanding combining all data sources

## Configuration

No configuration needed! The integration is automatic when:

1. ✅ Context Intelligence Bridge is initialized
2. ✅ Vision Intelligence is running
3. ✅ Main.py connects them (line 685)

## Testing

### Manual Test

1. Start Ironcliw: `python start_system.py`
2. Open Terminal in another desktop space
3. Run a command that causes an error: `python -c "import nonexistent"`
4. Ask Ironcliw: "can you see my terminal in the other window?"
5. Expected: Ironcliw mentions the specific error

### Logs to Check

```bash
# Context Intelligence initialization
🧠 Initializing Context Intelligence System...
✅ Vision Intelligence connected to Context Bridge

# Query processing
[VISION-INTEL] Getting structured context for query...
[VISION-INTEL] Found 2 errors, 3 commands across 2 spaces
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Browser Context**: Include active URLs, search queries
- **IDE Context**: Open files, current file, project name
- **Clipboard Integration**: Recent copies for context
- **File System Watching**: Track file changes correlated with terminal
- **ML Intent Classification**: Better query routing

## Summary

The integration creates a **unified intelligence system**:

- **Vision Intelligence** = Claude's eyes (what's on screen)
- **Context Intelligence** = Ironcliw's memory (structured state)
- **AsyncPipeline** = Orchestrator (combines both)

Result: **Accurate, proactive, context-aware responses** that truly understand your workspace! 🎉
