Want me to keep looking?"
```

**What to Check:**
- ✅ Duration mentioned in start message
- ✅ Helpful timeout message offers to continue
- ✅ Non-accusatory tone

## 🐛 Known Edge Cases

### Case 1: Rapid Sequential Operations
**What:** User runs 10 operations in quick succession
**Expected:** Milestone celebrates on 10th operation only, not every operation
**Status:** ✅ Handled - `last_milestone_announced` prevents duplicates

### Case 2: Same App Multiple Times
**What:** Monitor Chrome 5 times in a row
**Expected:** Learning acknowledgment only on FIRST Chrome surveillance
**Status:** ✅ Handled - `apps_monitored` set prevents duplicates

### Case 3: Zero Confidence Result
**What:** OCR completely fails, confidence = 0%
**Expected:** Low confidence message (<80%) triggers
**Status:** ✅ Handled - Else clause catches all <80%

### Case 4: Missing Result Fields
**What:** Result dict missing `window_count` or `space_id`
**Expected:** Graceful degradation, stats just omitted
**Status:** ✅ Handled - `.get()` with defaults

### Case 5: Failed Operation Recording
**What:** Surveillance fails, stats should still update
**Expected:** Operation recorded with `success=False`
**Status:** ✅ Handled - `_record_surveillance_operation()` in all paths

---

## 📊 Metrics to Verify

After testing, check:

```python
# Access from handler instance:
handler.surveillance_stats

# Should show:
{
    'total_operations': 25,
    'successful_detections': 22,
    'god_mode_operations': 15,
    'apps_monitored': {'Terminal', 'Chrome', 'Safari', 'VSCode'},
    'total_windows_watched': 67,
    'fastest_detection_time': 2.3,
    'average_confidence': 0.91,
}
```

---

## 🎤 Voice Testing

For TTS integration:

1. **Record responses** during testing
2. **Play back via `say` command:**
   ```bash
   say -v Daniel "Found it, Derek! I detected Error in Chrome on Space 3."
   ```
3. **Check for:**
   - Natural pauses (commas, periods)
   - Rising intonation (question marks)
   - No weird TTS artifacts
   - Appropriate emphasis

---

## ✨ Success Criteria

Test is successful when:

✅ **All 17 test scenarios pass**
✅ **Milestones celebrate at 10, 25, 50, 100**
✅ **Learning acknowledgments appear for first app, first God Mode**
✅ **Confidence levels adapt responses appropriately**
✅ **Time-aware messaging works (test at different hours)**
✅ **God Mode shows statistics (window count, space ID)**
✅ **Single window mode is simple and direct**
✅ **Errors are helpful and non-technical**
✅ **No repetitive messages (variations work)**
✅ **Stats tracking works correctly**

---

## 🚀 Final Check

Before declaring production-ready:

```bash
# 1. Compile check
python3 -m py_compile backend/voice/intelligent_command_handler.py

# 2. Run test suite
python3 test_voice_god_mode.py

# 3. Live test with supervisor
python3 run_supervisor.py

# 4. Try 5+ different commands
# 5. Verify milestones work (mock counter if needed)
# 6. Check stats are accurate
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Milestone testing:** May need to mock `surveillance_stats['total_operations']` to test 100th operation quickly
- **Learning testing:** Clear `apps_monitored` set to re-test first app acknowledgment
- **Confidence testing:** Use different trigger text clarity levels
- **Time testing:** Mock `datetime.now().hour` for different times
- **God Mode testing:** Requires multiple windows of same app across spaces
