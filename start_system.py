# GLOBAL SESSION MANAGER - Always available singleton for session tracking
# =============================================================================

class GlobalSessionManager:
    """
    Async-safe singleton manager for JARVIS session tracking.

    This manager is initialized early and provides guaranteed access to
    session tracking functionality throughout the application lifecycle,
    including during cleanup when other components may not be available.

    Features:
    - Singleton pattern with thread-safe initialization
    - Async-safe operations with asyncio.Lock
    - Early registration before other components
    - Guaranteed availability during cleanup
    - Automatic stale session cleanup
    - Multi-terminal conflict prevention

    Usage:
        # Get the singleton instance
        session_mgr = get_session_manager()

        # Register a VM
        await session_mgr.register_vm(vm_id, zone, components)

        # Get current session's VM
        vm_info = await session_mgr.get_my_vm()
