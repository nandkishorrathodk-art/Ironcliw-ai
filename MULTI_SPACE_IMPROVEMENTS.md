# Multi-Space Vision Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### Problem Solved
Ironcliw was incorrectly describing the browser's developer console when asked about "Terminal in the other window space" instead of describing the actual Terminal application.

### Root Causes Identified & Fixed

#### 1. **Terminal App Detection**
- **Issue**: Multi-space intelligence wasn't detecting "terminal" as a target app in queries
- **Fix**: Enhanced `_extract_by_known_apps()` to detect common apps like Terminal, Chrome, Safari, VSCode
- **File**: `backend/vision/multi_space_intelligence.py`

#### 2. **Screenshot Space Selection**
- **Issue**: System was capturing BOTH current space (with browser) AND target space (with Terminal)
- **Fix**: Modified `_determine_spaces_to_capture()` to exclude current space when query explicitly asks about "other" spaces
- **File**: `backend/api/pure_vision_intelligence.py`

#### 3. **Core Graphics Window Capture**
- **Working**: CG window capture successfully captures Terminal from other spaces WITHOUT switching
- **File**: `backend/vision/cg_window_capture.py` - Already working correctly

#### 4. **Enhanced Logging**
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track:
  - Which spaces are being captured
  - What apps are detected in queries
  - What windows are found in each space
  - Which screenshots are sent to Claude

### Key Improvements

1. **Smart Space Selection**: When user asks about "other window/space", Ironcliw now:
   - Detects this is specifically about OTHER spaces
   - Finds the target app (e.g., Terminal) in other spaces
   - ONLY captures those spaces, excluding current space
   - This prevents confusion between browser console and Terminal

2. **Better App Detection**: Common apps are now reliably detected:
   - Terminal (including "term", "shell", "bash", "zsh")
   - Chrome, Safari, Firefox
   - VSCode (including "vs code", "code editor")

3. **Clearer Prompts to Claude**: Enhanced prompts that:
   - Explicitly state when showing ONLY other spaces
   - Warn about Terminal vs browser console distinction
   - Direct focus to the specific app requested

### Testing Results

✅ Query: "Can you see my terminal in the other window space?"
- Correctly detects "Terminal" as target app
- Finds Terminal in Space 2
- Only captures Space 2 (excludes current Space 1)
- Successfully captures Terminal window using CG API
- No space switching required

### Files Modified

1. `backend/vision/multi_space_intelligence.py`
   - Enhanced `_extract_by_known_apps()` for better app detection

2. `backend/api/pure_vision_intelligence.py`
   - Modified `_determine_spaces_to_capture()` for smart space selection
   - Enhanced `_build_comprehensive_multi_space_prompt()` for clearer instructions
   - Added comprehensive debug logging

3. `backend/vision/multi_space_capture_engine.py`
   - Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
   - CG capture integration working correctly

### Usage

Now when a user asks Ironcliw about windows in "other" spaces:
- Ironcliw will correctly identify and capture only those spaces
- Terminal will be properly recognized and captured
- The response will describe the actual Terminal content, not browser console

### Example Queries That Now Work

- "Can you see my terminal in the other window space?"
- "What's happening in the terminal in another space?"
- "Show me the terminal in the different window"
- "Is there a terminal open in my other desktop?"
