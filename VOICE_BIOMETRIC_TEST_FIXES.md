# Voice Biometric Test Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ TEST 1: Voice Enrollment Status - Database Connection Error

**Problem:**
```
'IroncliwLearningDatabase' object has no attribute 'connection_pool'
```

The test was trying to access `db.connection_pool.connection()` directly, but the learning database object doesn't expose this attribute.

**Solution:**
Updated both test files to use the proper database API method:
- Changed from: `async with db.connection_pool.connection()` 
- Changed to: `profiles = await db.get_all_speaker_profiles()`

This uses the built-in method `get_all_speaker_profiles()` which properly handles both SQLite and Cloud SQL connections.

**Files Modified:**
- `test_voice_biometric_unlock_e2e.py` (lines 43-97)
- `check_voice_enrollment.py` (lines 16-57)

### 2. ❌ TEST 3: Owner Verification Flow - Wrong Field Name

**Problem:**
```
❌ FAIL: No owner profile found
```

The test was looking for `profile.get("is_owner")` but the speaker verification service stores profiles with the field name `is_primary_user`.

**Solution:**
Updated all references in the test to use the correct field name:
- Changed from: `profile.get("is_owner", False)`
- Changed to: `profile.get("is_primary_user", False)`

**Files Modified:**
- `test_voice_biometric_unlock_e2e.py` (lines 120, 150, 282)

## Technical Details

### Database Abstraction Layer
The learning database uses a robust abstraction layer that works with both:
- **SQLite** (local development)
- **Cloud SQL PostgreSQL** (production)

The proper way to query data is through the database's public methods:
- `get_all_speaker_profiles()` - Returns all speaker profiles with full BEAST MODE acoustic features
- `get_voice_samples_for_speaker()` - Returns voice samples for a specific speaker
- `record_voice_sample()` - Records new voice samples
- etc.

**Never access internal attributes like:**
- ❌ `db.connection_pool` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `db.db` (internal implementation detail)
- ❌ Direct SQL on `db.cursor()` without checking the wrapper

### Speaker Profile Schema
Speaker profiles in the verification service use these field names:
- `is_primary_user` - Boolean indicating if this is the device owner (Derek)
- `speaker_id` - Database ID
- `speaker_name` - Full name
- `embedding` - Voice embedding numpy array
- `acoustic_features` - BEAST MODE acoustic feature dict
- `total_samples` - Number of voice samples enrolled
- `security_level` - "high", "medium", "standard"
- `threshold` - Adaptive verification threshold

When verification results are returned, `is_primary_user` is mapped to `is_owner` for clarity.

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run the full E2E test suite
python test_voice_biometric_unlock_e2e.py

# Check enrollment status only
python check_voice_enrollment.py
```

## Notes

1. **TEST 3 will still show verification failures** with random audio (expected behavior)
   - The test generates random audio to test the verification flow
   - Real voice audio would verify successfully
   - The test passes as long as the flow executes without errors

2. **Database must be initialized** before running tests
   - Cloud SQL proxy must be running
   - Speaker profile must exist in database
   - Run `backend/voice_unlock/setup_voice_unlock.py` to enroll

3. **Profile hot-reload** is enabled automatically
   - The service monitors for profile updates every 30 seconds
   - No restart needed when profiles are updated
