## What is Ironcliw?

**Ironcliw** (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a sophisticated AI assistant that combines:

- **Production Voice System** - Real ECAPA-TDNN embeddings, SpeechBrain STT, unified TTS
- **Voice Biometric Authentication** - Secure screen unlock with 95%+ confidence matching
- **Hybrid Cloud Architecture** - Local Mac (16GB) + GCP Spot VMs (32GB, 60-91% cost savings)
- **Multi-Agent Intelligence** - 60+ specialized agents (UAE, SAI, CAI, learning_database)
- **Advanced Vision** - Claude Vision API integration with multi-space desktop awareness
- **Continuous Learning** - Every interaction improves system intelligence
- **Self-Healing** - Automatic error detection and recovery
