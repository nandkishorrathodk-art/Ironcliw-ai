## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd /Users/djrussell23/Documents/repos/Ironcliw-AI-Agent
python3 run_supervisor.py
```

**Note:** Pass your name to the narrator for personalization:
```python
from backend.core.supervisor.startup_narrator import get_startup_narrator

narrator = get_startup_narrator(user_name="Derek")  # Replace with your name
```

print(narrator.startup_stats)

# Should show:
{
    'total_startups': 25,
    'successful_startups': 23,
    'partial_startups': 2,
    'failed_startups': 0,
    'average_startup_time': 12.4,
    'fastest_startup_time': 7.1,
    'slowest_startup_time': 45.3,
    'first_startup_ever': False,
    'first_startup_today': False,
    'last_startup_date': datetime.date(2025, 12, 29),
    'consecutive_fast_startups': 3,

## 🐛 Known Edge Cases

### Case 1: Very First Startup (No History)
**What:** First time ever running Ironcliw
**Expected:** "First startup complete" learning message
**Status:** ✅ Handled - `first_startup_ever` flag

### Case 2: Midnight Rollover
**What:** First startup after midnight
**Expected:** "First startup today" message
**Status:** ✅ Handled - Checks `last_startup_date` vs current date

### Case 3: Extremely Fast Startup (<5s)
**What:** Unusually fast startup
**Expected:** Still treated as EXCELLENT, celebrated
**Status:** ✅ Handled - EXCELLENT is <10s threshold

### Case 4: Extremely Slow Startup (>120s)
**What:** Very slow startup
**Expected:** PARTIAL or PROBLEMATIC confidence
**Status:** ✅ Handled - PARTIAL is >60s

### Case 5: No Duration Provided
**What:** `duration_seconds=None` passed
**Expected:** Calculate from `_startup_start_time` or use 15s default
**Status:** ✅ Handled - Automatic calculation or fallback

## 🚀 Final Check

Before declaring production-ready:

```bash
# 1. Compile check
python3 -m py_compile backend/core/supervisor/startup_narrator.py

# 2. Multiple test startups
for i in {1..10}; do
    python3 run_supervisor.py
    # Wait for completion, then restart
done

# 3. Verify stats
# Check that 10th startup has milestone celebration

# 4. Test different times
# Mock datetime.now().hour for different hours if needed

# 5. Test failures
# Simulate service failures and verify PARTIAL/PROBLEMATIC confidence
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Milestone testing:** Stats persist across restarts if saved to disk
- **Time testing:** May need to mock `datetime.now().hour` for comprehensive time testing
- **First startup:** Clear stats to re-test first startup experience
- **User name:** Pass to `get_startup_narrator(user_name="Derek")` for personalization
