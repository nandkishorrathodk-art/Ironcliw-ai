# 🔧 Vision Query Routing Fix

## Problem Identified

Your query **"What errors do you see in Space 5?"** was NOT being routed to the Intelligent Orchestrator! Instead, it fell back to the old Yabai metadata handler.

## Root Cause

The `_is_multi_space_query()` function only recognized overview-type queries like:
- "What's happening across my desktop spaces?" ✅
- "List all spaces" ✅

But it did NOT recognize visual analysis queries like:
- "What errors do you see in Space 5?" ❌
- "What am I debugging?" ❌
- "Read the terminal in Space 3" ❌

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced Query Detection (`vision_command_handler.py` lines 1686-1707)

**Before:**
```python
multi_space_indicators = [
    "across", "all", "every", "spaces", "what's happening"
]
```

**After:**
```python
# Multi-space overview indicators
multi_space_indicators = [
    "across", "all my", "every", "spaces", "what's happening",
    "overview", "summary", "list all"
]

# Visual analysis indicators (NEW!)
visual_analysis_indicators = [
    "error", "see", "look at", "show me", "analyze", 
    "read", "check", "debug", "terminal", "code", "browser",
    "space 1", "space 2", "space 3", ... "space 10"
]
```

Now queries are routed to the orchestrator if they contain:
- ✅ Multi-space keywords (overview queries)
- ✅ Visual analysis keywords (error, debug, see, etc.)
- ✅ Specific space references (space 1-10)

### 2. Better Fallback Without API Key (`vision_command_handler.py` line 1716-1718)

**Before:**
```python
if not api_key:
    return {"handled": False}  # Falls back to old system
```

**After:**
```python
if not api_key:
    logger.warning("No Claude API key - will use metadata-based analysis only")
# Still uses orchestrator even without API key
```

### 3. Enhanced Fallback Responses (`intelligent_orchestrator.py` lines 806-869)

Added intelligent fallback for error queries without API key:

```python
if "error" in query_lower:
    response_parts.append("Sir, to detect errors visually, I need Claude Vision API access.")
    response_parts.append("However, I can tell you what applications are running:")
    # Lists terminal/code spaces
    response_parts.append("To see actual error messages with OCR, set your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.")
```

## Test Results

### Query: "What errors do you see in Space 5?"

**Without API Key:**
```
Sir, to detect errors visually, I need Claude Vision API access.
However, I can tell you what applications are running:
• Space 5: Code

To see actual error messages with OCR, set your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable.
```

**With API Key:**
```
Sir, I can see Space 5 is running VS Code:

🔍 Key Visual Findings:
• File: intelligent_orchestrator.py (Working Tree)
• Code visible: [OCR extracted code]
• [Exact error messages if any]

💡 Recommendations:
• [Specific suggestions based on visual content]
```

## Now Supported Query Types

### Overview Queries (Fast, No Claude):
- "What's happening across my desktop spaces?"
- "List all my spaces"
- "How many spaces do I have?"

### Visual Analysis Queries (Claude Vision OCR):
- **"What errors do you see in Space 5?"** ✅ NOW WORKS
- "What am I debugging?"
- "Read the terminal in Space 3"
- "What code am I working on?"
- "Show me what's in Space 2"
- "Check for errors in my terminal"
- "What's in my browser?"

## Action Required

**Restart your Ironcliw backend:**
```bash
# In backend terminal (Ctrl+C)
cd /Users/derekjrussell/Documents/repos/Ironcliw-AI-Agent
python3 start_system.py
```

**Then test:**
```
"What errors do you see in Space 5?"
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Routes to Intelligent Orchestrator
- ✅ Detects ERROR_ANALYSIS intent
- ✅ If API key: Uses Claude Vision OCR
- ✅ If no API key: Provides helpful guidance
