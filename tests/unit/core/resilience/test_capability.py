"""
Tests for CapabilityUpgrade hot-swapping between degraded and full modes.

Tests cover:
- Starts in DEGRADED state
- try_upgrade() succeeds when available
- try_upgrade() fails when not available
- downgrade() returns to DEGRADED state
- on_upgrade callback is called on successful upgrade
- on_downgrade callback is called on downgrade
- Monitoring attempts upgrade periodically
- Monitoring detects regression
- stop_monitoring() is clean
- State transitions
- Thread safety
