# 2026-02-18 — Real-Time Voice Conversation + README Updates

## What Happened

### Real-Time Voice Conversation Infrastructure (v238.0)
- Completed full implementation of 7-layer audio infrastructure (Layers -1 through 6)
- 10 new files, 12 evolved files, 13 commits on main
- Two-phase bootstrap: AudioBus before narrator, full pipeline after Intelligence
- All 17 fixes implemented across 4 priority tiers (P0-P3)
- Dependencies installed: piper-tts, speexdsp (built from source), faster-whisper, samplerate
- Ironcliw_AUDIO_BUS_ENABLED=true set in .env files
- Branch is ahead of origin/main by 13 commits (not yet pushed)

### README Updates (all 3 repos)
- **Ironcliw README**: Added comprehensive v238.0 Real-Time Voice Conversation section with architecture diagram, 7-layer table, design decisions, configuration, files list. Added v248.0 roadmap for Voice V2 (ML turn detection, tonal awareness, speaker diarization).
- **jarvis-prime README**: Added Voice Conversation Infrastructure section explaining J-Prime's role as streaming LLM backend. Added version history entry. Key point: no J-Prime code changes were needed — existing SSE streaming + sticky routing handles voice natively.
- **reactor-core README**: Added voice conversation version history entry with training data implications table. Added v248.0 roadmap for voice conversation training data pipeline (conversational DPO pairs, conciseness training, turn-detection classifier). Updated cross-repo integration section. Updated Known Gaps.

## Key Decisions
- Build conversation orchestrator from scratch (not Pipecat) — avoids "two competing pipelines" problem
- AudioBus is a constraint, not a convention — FullDuplexDevice callback is private to AudioBus
- AEC replaces time-based cooldowns in conversation mode
- Feature flag (Ironcliw_AUDIO_BUS_ENABLED) for safe rollback to legacy audio paths
- J-Prime SSE streaming required no changes — voice conversation uses existing /v1/chat/completions API
