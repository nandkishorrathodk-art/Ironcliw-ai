# 🎓 Ironcliw Continuous Voice Learning System

## Overview
A comprehensive, self-improving voice recognition system with **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **automatic sample freshness management**.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Record 30 Fresh Voice Samples
```bash
python backend/voice/enroll_voice.py --speaker "Derek J. Russell" --samples 30
```

### Resume Interrupted Enrollment
```bash
python backend/voice/enroll_voice.py --resume
```

### Refresh Existing Profile
```bash
python backend/voice/enroll_voice.py --refresh --samples 10
```

---

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Voice Sample Storage**
Every interaction with Ironcliw is automatically stored:
- Raw audio data (WAV format)
- Speaker embeddings (192D ECAPA-TDNN)
- Confidence scores
- Quality metrics (SNR, clipping, noise)
- Environment type
- Transcription
- Timestamp

**Location**: Both SQLite (local) and CloudSQL (production)

### 2. **Continuous Learning with ML**
- **Incremental Learning**: Updates profile after every 10 samples
- **Weighted Averaging**: Recent samples weighted higher (30% new, 70% existing)
- **Quality Weighting**: Better quality samples have more influence
- **Automatic Retraining**: Triggers when enough feedback collected

### 3. **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**
```python
# Apply feedback to a verification attempt
await service.apply_human_feedback(
    verification_id=sample_id,
    correct=True,  # Was this verification correct?
    notes="Successful unlock in noisy environment"
)
```

- Tracks correct/incorrect verifications
- Uses feedback scores to weight training
- Triggers retraining after 10 feedback points

### 4. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- Searches for similar successful voice patterns
- Uses cosine similarity to find best matches
- Boosts confidence when patterns align
- Top-K retrieval for fast matching

### 5. **Rolling Embeddings**
- Maintains last 10 successful verifications in memory
- Computes weighted average (recent = higher weight)
- Updates profile dynamically without database writes
- Provides instant adaptation

### 6. **Sample Freshness Management**

#### Automatic Aging System
```python
# Check and manage sample freshness
stats = await learning_db.manage_sample_freshness(
    speaker_name="Derek J. Russell",
    max_age_days=30,  # Samples older than 30 days are "stale"
    target_sample_count=100  # Maintain 100 active samples
)
```

**What it does**:
- ✅ Archives samples older than 30 days
- ✅ Keeps best samples based on quality + confidence
- ✅ Maintains target count automatically
- ✅ Provides freshness score (0-1)
- ✅ Generates recommendations

#### Freshness Strategies

**Strategy 1: Age-Based Archival**
- Samples > 60 days: Archived (unless used for training)
- Samples 30-60 days: Monitored
- Samples < 30 days: Active

**Strategy 2: Quality-Based Retention**
- Score = (confidence × quality) / (1 + age/30)
- Top samples retained up to target count
- Low-quality old samples archived first

**Strategy 3: Distribution Balance**
- Ensures samples from different time periods
- Maintains representation across environments
- Prevents bias toward specific conditions

#### Get Freshness Report
```python
report = await learning_db.get_sample_freshness_report("Derek J. Russell")

# Example output:
{
    'age_distribution': {
        '0-7 days': {'count': 15, 'avg_confidence': 0.82, 'avg_quality': 0.91},
        '8-14 days': {'count': 12, 'avg_confidence': 0.78, 'avg_quality': 0.88},
        '15-30 days': {'count': 8, 'avg_confidence': 0.75, 'avg_quality': 0.85},
        '31-60 days': {'count': 5, 'avg_confidence': 0.68, 'avg_quality': 0.80},
        '60+ days': {'count': 10, 'avg_confidence': 0.52, 'avg_quality': 0.72}
    },
    'recommendations': [
        {
            'priority': 'HIGH',
            'action': 'Record new samples',
            'reason': 'Only 15/50 samples are recent (< 7 days)'
        }
    ],
    'freshness_score': 0.73
}
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Voice Interaction Flow

```
1. You say: "unlock my screen"
   ↓
2. Audio captured (int16 PCM → float32)
   ↓
3. Embedding extracted (ECAPA-TDNN 192D)
   ↓
4. RAG searches for similar patterns
   ↓
5. Multi-stage verification:
   - Primary: Embedding comparison
   - Acoustic: Voice features match
   - Temporal: Pattern consistency
   - Adaptive: Historical alignment
   ↓
6. Confidence boosted if patterns match
   ↓
7. Sample stored in database:
   - Audio data
   - Embedding
   - Confidence score
   - Quality metrics
   - Environment type
   ↓
8. After 10 samples → Auto-retraining
   ↓
9. Profile updated with new knowledge
   ↓
10. Freshness managed automatically
```

### Confidence Progression

```
Attempt #1-5:    17% → 22% → 28% → 35% → 42%
                 (Learning basic patterns)

Attempt #6-15:   42% → 51% → 58% → 65% → 72%
                 (Building consistency)

Attempt #16-30:  72% → 78% → 82% → 86% → 90%
                 (Expert recognition) ✅ UNLOCKS

Attempt #31+:    90% → 93% → 95%
                 (Optimal performance)
```

### Sample Freshness Lifecycle

```
Day 1-7:    FRESH    (100% active, full weight)
Day 8-14:   GOOD     (90% weight)
Day 15-30:  FAIR     (70% weight)
Day 31-60:  AGING    (40% weight, monitored)
Day 61+:    STALE    (Archived unless high-quality)
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### To Maximize Recognition Speed

1. **Record 30 samples upfront**
   ```bash
   python backend/voice/enroll_voice.py --samples 30
   ```
   - Immediate confidence boost to 50-70%
   - Captures voice diversity

2. **Use Ironcliw regularly**
   - Every "unlock my screen" improves the model
   - Automatic learning kicks in after 10 attempts

3. **Provide feedback when possible**
   - Mark incorrect verifications
   - System learns from mistakes

4. **Refresh samples monthly**
   ```bash
   python backend/voice/enroll_voice.py --refresh --samples 10
   ```
   - Keeps profile current
   - Adapts to voice changes

### To Maintain Freshness

1. **Check freshness monthly**
   ```python
   report = await learning_db.get_sample_freshness_report("Derek J. Russell")
   ```

2. **Run auto-management weekly**
   ```python
   stats = await learning_db.manage_sample_freshness("Derek J. Russell")
   ```

3. **Record new samples when freshness < 70%**
   - System will recommend automatically
   - Prevents performance degradation

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjust Learning Parameters

In `speaker_verification_service.py`:

```python
# Continuous learning
self.ml_update_frequency = 10  # Update after N samples
self.incremental_learning = True
self.embedding_update_weight = 0.1  # 10% new, 90% old
self.auto_retrain_threshold = 50  # Retrain after N samples

# Rolling embeddings
self.max_rolling_samples = 10  # Keep last 10
self.rolling_weight = 0.3  # 30% weight for rolling avg

# RLHF
self.min_feedback_for_retrain = 10
```

### Adjust Freshness Parameters

In `learning_database.py`:

```python
await manage_sample_freshness(
    speaker_name="Derek J. Russell",
    max_age_days=30,        # Stale threshold
    target_sample_count=100  # Active samples to maintain
)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Confidence Not Improving?

1. **Check sample freshness**
   ```python
   report = await learning_db.get_sample_freshness_report("Derek J. Russell")
   ```

2. **Record in current environment**
   - Old samples may be from different mic/location
   - Re-enroll in your current setup

3. **Check audio quality**
   - SNR should be > 10 dB
   - Minimize background noise

### Samples Getting Stale?

1. **Enable auto-refresh**
   ```python
   await learning_db.manage_sample_freshness("Derek J. Russell")
   ```

2. **Schedule monthly enrollment**
   ```bash
   # Add to cron
   0 0 1 * * python backend/voice/enroll_voice.py --refresh --samples 10
   ```
