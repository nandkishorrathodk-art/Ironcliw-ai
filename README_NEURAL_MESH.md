**Typical Day:**
```
6:00 AM  - Wake up, run local workflows (FREE)
9:00 AM  - Connect to TV, process screenshots (FREE)
2:00 PM  - Heavy ML task triggers cloud VM ($0.25 for 4 hours)
6:00 PM  - Cloud VM auto-shuts down after idle
10:00 PM - Evening tasks run local (FREE)

Daily cost: $0.25
Monthly cost: $7.50
```
