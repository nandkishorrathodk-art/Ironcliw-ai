## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

**Problem**: `⚠️  No ElevenLabs API key found`

**Solution**:
```bash
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY='your-key-here'
source ~/.zshrc
```

### No Voices Found

**Problem**: `Auto-selected 0 voices`

**Solution**: Run wizard again, or manually configure voices in `setup_elevenlabs_voices.py`

### API Rate Limit

**Problem**: `❌ API error 429: Rate limit exceeded`

**Solution**: Wait 1 minute and retry. Free tier has rate limits.
