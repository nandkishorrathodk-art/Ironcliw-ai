## 📊 Implementation Priority Recommendations

### HIGH PRIORITY (Implement First)

1. **Computer Use Visual Authentication Context** ⚠️
   - **Why:** Critical for security (detect ransomware, privacy violations)
   - **Effort:** Medium (use existing Claude Computer Use APIs)
   - **Impact:** High (prevents sophisticated attacks)

2. **Enhanced Multi-Attempt Retry Logic** ⚠️
   - **Why:** Improves user experience on failures
   - **Effort:** Low (extend existing retry logic)
   - **Impact:** High (reduces frustration)

3. **Voice Evolution Auto-Adaptation** ⚠️
   - **Why:** Prevents authentication degradation over time
   - **Effort:** Medium (use existing drift detection)
   - **Impact:** High (maintains accuracy)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Implement Second)

4. **Security Incident Investigation Dashboard** ⚠️
   - **Why:** Enables forensic analysis
   - **Effort:** Medium (query existing Langfuse data)
   - **Impact:** Medium (security power users)

5. **Milestone Celebration System** ⚠️
   - **Why:** Gamification, user engagement
   - **Effort:** Low (extend existing stats)
   - **Impact:** Low (nice-to-have)

### LOW PRIORITY (Implement Last)

6. **Playwright Remote Authentication** ⚠️
   - **Why:** Edge case (most users authenticate locally)
   - **Effort:** High (new subsystem)
   - **Impact:** Low (rarely used)
