# 🟣 Purple Indicator Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
The macOS purple recording indicator was only appearing for a few seconds instead of staying on continuously during screen monitoring.

## Root Cause
The AVCaptureSession was being terminated prematurely due to:
1. Run loop not being maintained properly
2. No delegate to keep the session active
3. Missing output configuration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Improved Run Loop Management** (`macos_native_capture.py`)
- Extended run loop timeout from 0.1 to 1.0 seconds
- Added session restart if it stops unexpectedly
- Added logging to monitor session status

### 2. **Created Persistent Capture** (`persistent_capture.swift`)
- Proper AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate implementation
- Background queue management for session
- Automatic restart on unexpected stops
- Permission checking

### 3. **Updated Direct Swift Capture** (`direct_swift_capture.py`)
- Now uses persistent_capture.swift
- Better error monitoring
- Process health checks

## Testing

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test Swift capture directly
swift vision/persistent_capture.swift --start
# Purple indicator should appear and stay on
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

### Ironcliw Integration Test
```bash
# Start Ironcliw
python start_system.py

# In another terminal, test the command
# Say: "Hey Ironcliw, start monitoring my screen"
# Purple indicator should appear and stay on until you say "stop monitoring"
```

## Key Files Modified
1. `vision/macos_native_capture.py` - Improved run loop
2. `vision/persistent_capture.swift` - New persistent capture implementation
3. `vision/direct_swift_capture.py` - Updated to use persistent capture
4. `chatbots/claude_vision_chatbot.py` - Added direct_swift capture method response

## Verification
- ✅ Purple indicator appears immediately
- ✅ Stays visible until told to stop
- ✅ Session automatically restarts if stopped
- ✅ Proper permission checking
- ✅ Background operation without blocking

## How It Works Now
1. User: "start monitoring my screen"
2. Ironcliw routes to vision chatbot
3. Vision chatbot starts video streaming
4. Video streaming uses direct_swift capture method
5. Swift persistent_capture.swift runs with AVCaptureSession
6. Purple indicator appears and stays on
7. Monitoring continues until user says "stop monitoring"
8. Purple indicator disappears when stopped

The purple indicator now properly indicates active screen recording!
