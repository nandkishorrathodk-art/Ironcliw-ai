    🧠 Ironcliw Zero Hardcoding Demo
    ======================================
    Welcome to the future of AI assistants!
    
    This demo shows how Ironcliw now uses pure machine learning
    with ZERO hardcoded patterns. Everything is learned and adaptive.
    
    Key Features:
    • No keyword matching
    • No hardcoded rules  
    • No manual configuration
    • Learns from every interaction
    • Self-improving accuracy
