Cross-Repo Startup Orchestrator v5.0 - Enterprise-Grade Process Lifecycle Manager
===================================================================================

Dynamic service discovery and self-healing process orchestration for JARVIS ecosystem.
Enables single-command startup of all Trinity components (JARVIS Body, J-Prime Mind, Reactor-Core Nerves).

Features (v5.0):
- 🔧 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: Ports from trinity_config.py (no hardcoding!)
- 🧹 Pre-flight Cleanup: Kills stale processes on legacy ports (8002, 8003)
- 🔍 Wrong-Binding Detection: Detects 127.0.0.1 vs 0.0.0.0 misconfigurations
- 🔄 Auto-Healing with exponential backoff (dead process detection & restart)
- 📡 Real-Time Output Streaming (stdout/stderr prefixed per service)
- 🎯 Process Lifecycle Management (spawn, monitor, graceful shutdown)
- 🛡️ Graceful Shutdown Handlers (SIGINT/SIGTERM cleanup)
- 🐍 Auto-detect venv Python for each repo
- 📁 Correct entry points: run_server.py, run_reactor.py
- ⚡ Pre-spawn validation (port check, dependency check)
- 📊 Service Health Monitoring with progressive backoff

Service Ports (v5.0 - from trinity_config.py):
- jarvis-prime: port 8000 (run_server.py --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0)
- reactor-core: port 8090 (run_reactor.py --port 8090)
- jarvis-body: port 8010 (main JARVIS)

Legacy ports cleaned up automatically:
- jarvis-prime: 8001, 8002 (killed if found)
- reactor-core: 8003, 8004, 8005 (killed if found)

Author: JARVIS AI System
Version: 5.14.0 (v147.0)

Changelog:
- v147.0 (v5.14): UNBREAKABLE ARCHITECTURE - Proactive Rescue & Crash Pre-Cognition
  - PART 1 PROACTIVE RESCUE: Real-time log analysis detects memory stress BEFORE crash
    - Pattern matching for: MEMORY EMERGENCY, OOM Warning, load shedding, survival mode
    - On detection: Triggers GCP provisioning IMMEDIATELY (don't wait for -9)
    - Controlled restart is better than kernel kill
  - PART 2 ATOMIC CLOUD LOCK: Corruption-proof state persistence
    - Temp file + atomic rename strategy (survives power failure during write)
    - Auto-creation of ~/.jarvis/trinity/ directory
    - JSON schema validation on load
  - PART 3 ELASTIC SCALING: Hardware upgrade detection
    - On startup: If RAM > 32GB but cloud lock exists, AUTO-RELEASE lock
    - "User upgraded hardware" → return to local mode automatically
    - No manual intervention needed after RAM upgrade
  - PART 4 CONSECUTIVE OOM CIRCUIT BREAKER: Prevents infinite crash loops
    - Tracks consecutive OOMs even in cloud mode
    - After 3 consecutive OOMs: Mark DEGRADED, stop restarting
    - Prevents infinite billable GCP loops
  - ROOT CAUSE FIX: System now PREDICTS crashes instead of just recovering from them
- v146.0 (v5.13): TRINITY PROTOCOL - Elastic Hybrid Cloud Architecture
  - PART 1 CLOUD-FIRST STRATEGY: Proactive GCP pre-warming on SLIM hardware
    - Background asyncio task starts GCP provisioning IMMEDIATELY during startup
    - Non-blocking: Does not delay service startup, VM warms in parallel
    - GCP ready by the time first request arrives (no 2-minute cold start)
  - PART 2 CLOUD LOCK PERSISTENCE: OOM events create persistent lock file
    - ~/.jarvis/trinity/cloud_lock.json survives supervisor restarts
    - After OOM crash, system FORCES cloud mode until manually cleared
    - Prevents "OOM → restart → OOM" infinite loop across restarts
  - PART 3 REACTOR-CORE SEQUENCING: reactor-core waits for jarvis-prime health
    - Dependency ordering ensures heavy training waits for inference
    - Prevents "Thundering Herd" where both grab RAM simultaneously
  - PART 4 TRINITY EVENT BUS: Cross-repo health coordination
    - Background health monitoring with asyncio.Event for readiness
    - GCP warm-up completion triggers jarvis-prime spawn eligibility
  - ROOT CAUSE FIX: GCP was provisioned AFTER spawn, now provisioned DURING startup
- v145.0 (v5.12): TOTAL VICTORY - Self-Kill Protection Bypass & Final Deadlock Fix
  - CRITICAL FIX: Port Hygiene now allows killing service's own OLD PID for restart
  - Added `exclude_service` parameter to `_build_protected_pid_set()`
  - Added `allow_self_kill` parameter to `_enforce_port_hygiene()`
  - ROOT CAUSE: Old jarvis-prime PID was protected, preventing port 8000 cleanup
  - The supervisor was literally protecting the zombie it needed to kill
  - GAP 14: Self-Kill Protection Bypass solves the restart deadlock
- v144.0 (v5.11): HOLLOW CLIENT & ACTIVE RESCUE - Nuclear OOM Prevention
  - PART 1 HOLLOW CLIENT: jarvis-prime now uses strict lazy imports (torch/transformers)
    - Startup RAM reduced from ~4GB to ~300MB
    - Heavy ML libs only loaded when actually doing inference
    - New JARVIS_GCP_OFFLOAD_ACTIVE env var blocks local heavy imports
    - Slim Mode + GCP Active = Hollow Client that routes to GCP
  - PART 2 ACTIVE RESCUE: GCP VM provisioned BEFORE spawning jarvis-prime on SLIM hardware
    - force_cloud_hybrid flag automatically set when profile is SLIM or CLOUD_ONLY
    - ensure_gcp_vm_ready_for_prime() waits for GCP VM before spawn (async, timeout 120s)
    - JARVIS_GCP_OFFLOAD_ACTIVE=true and GCP_PRIME_ENDPOINT injected to subprocess
    - On Exit -9 (OOM): NO LOCAL RESTART, force GCP provisioning first
    - OOM Death Handler triggers cloud rescue instead of local retry loop
  - RESULT: The Life Raft (GCP) is now deployed BEFORE you need it, not after you drown
  - ROOT CAUSE FIX: GCP was "tied to the dock" - only provisioned AFTER local crashes
- v143.0 (v5.10): OPERATION HOLLOW CLIENT - Early Hardware Detection
  - CRITICAL FIX: Set JARVIS_ENABLE_SLIM_MODE in supervisor's OWN environment at startup
  - Hardware assessment now runs FIRST in start_all_services() BEFORE any spawn attempts
  - Added set_hardware_env_in_supervisor() to set all hardware env vars early
  - log_hardware_assessment() now also sets env vars (defense in depth)
  - The v142.0 memory gate can now properly detect Slim Mode from os.environ
  - ROOT CAUSE: Memory gate checked env var that was only passed to subprocess, not set locally
- v142.0 (v5.9): DYNAMIC MEMORY GATING - Context-Aware Slim Mode Support
  - Fixed DEADLOCK: Supervisor was blocking jarvis-prime even when Slim Mode only needs ~300MB
  - Memory gate now CONTEXT-AWARE: checks JARVIS_ENABLE_SLIM_MODE env and hardware profile
  - SLIM MODE thresholds: 95% max memory usage, 0.5GB minimum free (vs 80%/2GB for FULL mode)
  - Auto-detect Slim Mode for jarvis-prime on systems with <32GB RAM
  - Enhanced SystemExit protection in I/O thread pool to prevent ugly stack traces
  - Graceful thread pool shutdown with timeout and forced exit handling
  - ROOT CAUSE: Users couldn't use GCP Cloud because the Local Client (Slim Mode) was blocked!
- v137.0 (v5.8): I/O Airlock Pattern - Non-Blocking File & System Operations
  - Dedicated ThreadPoolExecutor (4 workers) for I/O operations
  - Prevents event loop blocking from synchronous file I/O (json.loads, read_text)
  - Non-blocking psutil wrappers for network connections, process info, memory
  - Zombie-safe PID verification with cmdline checking
  - Async convenience wrappers: read_json_nonblocking, write_json_nonblocking

# v144.0: ACTIVE RESCUE SYSTEM - GCP VM Provisioning Before Spawn
# =============================================================================
# The Active Rescue system ensures the GCP "Life Raft" is deployed BEFORE
# jarvis-prime starts on SLIM hardware, not after it crashes from OOM.
#
# This breaks the deadlock where:
#   1. User needs GCP Cloud to save RAM
#   2. To use GCP, jarvis-prime needs to start (even in Slim Mode)
#   3. But jarvis-prime crashes from OOM before it can route to GCP
#   4. Result: Can't use Cloud because Local Client keeps crashing
#
# Active Rescue solves this by:
#   1. Detecting SLIM/CLOUD_ONLY hardware profile
#   2. Provisioning GCP VM BEFORE spawning jarvis-prime
#   3. Passing GCP endpoint to jarvis-prime via environment variables
#   4. jarvis-prime starts as Hollow Client (lazy imports) and routes to GCP

# =============================================================================
# This system prevents event loop blocking caused by synchronous file I/O
# and system calls (psutil) during startup orchestration.
#
# ROOT CAUSE ADDRESSED:
# - json.loads(file.read_text()) blocks the event loop for 10-500ms
# - psutil.net_connections() blocks for 50-200ms
# - psutil.Process(pid) can block for 10-100ms
# - Multiple calls during startup can cause cumulative 1-5s hangs
#
# SOLUTION:
# - Dedicated ThreadPoolExecutor with 4 workers for I/O operations
# - async wrapper _run_blocking_io() with configurable timeout
# - Safe state readers that handle corruption/missing files
# - Zombie-safe PID verification with cmdline checking

        - New jarvis-prime can't start

        v95.0: Enterprise-grade dedicated heartbeat loop.

        CRITICAL: This loop runs INDEPENDENTLY of health checks.

        The previous design had a fundamental flaw:
        - Heartbeats were only sent when HTTP health checks passed
        - If health checks failed, no heartbeat was sent
        - This caused running services to be marked "stale" and removed
        - Even if the process was alive, it would be deregistered

        This new design ensures:
        1. Heartbeats are sent as long as the process is alive
        2. Health status is included in the heartbeat (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)
        3. Services are NEVER marked stale if their process is running
        4. Separate heartbeat interval (faster than health check interval)
        5. Automatic recovery with fire-and-forget pattern

        The heartbeat loop sends status-aware heartbeats:
        - "healthy": HTTP health check passed
        - "degraded": Process alive but HTTP check failed
        - "starting": Process just started, not yet healthy
        - "process_alive": Fallback when health status unknown

        port release), we dynamically allocate an alternative port and update

        Features:

        - Uses socket binding test for reliability (not just connect test)
        - Updates the distributed port registry for cross-repo coordination

        # memory is critically low. Unlike the OOM Prevention bridge (which is
        # advisory), this will BLOCK startup if memory is dangerously low.
        #
        # v142.0 ENHANCEMENT: The gate is now CONTEXT-AWARE:
        #   - SLIM MODE: The Hollow Client only needs ~300MB, so we allow up to
        #     95% memory usage with 0.5GB minimum free. This unblocks the deadlock
        #     where the Supervisor blocks jarvis-prime startup even though Slim Mode
        #     specifically exists to offload heavy work to GCP.
        #   - FULL MODE: Standard thresholds (80% max, 2GB minimum free).
        #
        # ROOT CAUSE FIX: Without this, users are stuck in a deadlock:
        #   1. They need GCP Cloud to save RAM
        #   2. To use GCP, they need jarvis-prime to start (even in Slim Mode)
        #   3. The old gate blocked jarvis-prime because RAM was at 85%

        Wait for service to become healthy with intelligent progress-based timeout extension.

        v93.5: Enhanced with intelligent progress detection:

        PHASE 1 (Quick): Wait for server to start responding (max 60s)
        - Server starts listening on port
        - Health endpoint returns any status (including "starting")
        - If this times out, the service failed to start

        PHASE 2 (Patient + Intelligent): Wait for model to load with progress detection
        - Health endpoint returns "healthy" status
        - Server is up, loading models in background
        - KEY ENHANCEMENT: If progress is detected (model_load_elapsed increasing),
          timeout is dynamically extended up to max_startup_timeout
        - This prevents timeout when model is actively loading (just slow)

        v108.1: Non-blocking model loading mode:
        - When background_model_loading=True, returns after Phase 1 (server responding)
        - Phase 2 (model loading) continues in background task
        - This allows the main JARVIS backend to start while J-Prime loads its model

        This prevents the scenario where:
        - Server takes 5s to start listening
        - Model takes 304s to load (just 4s over 300s timeout)
        - Old approach: times out at 300s even though model was 98% loaded
        - New approach: detects progress, extends timeout, model loads successfully
