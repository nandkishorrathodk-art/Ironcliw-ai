Cross-Space Intelligence System - Advanced Multi-Space Understanding for JARVIS
==============================================================================

This system provides JARVIS with the ability to:
- Detect when activities across spaces are semantically related (not just pattern-based)
- Synthesize information from multiple sources into coherent understanding
- Provide workspace-wide answers drawing from all spaces
- Learn and adapt correlation strategies without hardcoding

Architecture:
    CrossSpaceIntelligence (Main Coordinator)
    ├── SemanticCorrelator (Content-based relationship detection)
    ├── ActivityCorrelationEngine (Multi-dimensional correlation)
    ├── MultiSourceSynthesizer (Information synthesis)
    ├── WorkspaceQueryResolver (Workspace-wide query answering)
    └── RelationshipGraph (Dynamic relationship tracking)

Key Capabilities:
    1. Semantic Understanding: "npm error" in terminal + "npm documentation" in browser = related
    2. Temporal Correlation: Activities happening within similar timeframes are likely related
    3. Behavioral Patterns: User switches spaces → activities are likely connected
    4. Content Synthesis: Combine terminal error + browser solution + code change = full story
    5. Dynamic Learning: No hardcoded patterns - learns from activity patterns

Example Scenarios:
    - Terminal shows "ECONNREFUSED" → Browser shows "redis not running" → Related debugging
    - Code file changes in Space 1 → Test output in Space 2 → Development workflow
    - Slack message in Space 3 → Documentation editing in Space 1 → Collaboration
    - Error in Space 1 → StackOverflow in Space 2 → Code fix in Space 3 → Problem solving

NO HARDCODING: All relationship detection is based on:
    - Keyword extraction and matching
    - Temporal proximity
    - User behavior patterns
    - Semantic similarity
