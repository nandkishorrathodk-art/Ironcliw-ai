JARVIS Intelligent Startup Narrator v3.0 - Intelligent Speech Edition
======================================================================

Provides intelligent, phase-aware voice narration during JARVIS startup.
Coordinates with the visual loading page to provide complementary
(not redundant) audio feedback.

v3.0 ENHANCEMENTS:
- Topic-based cooldowns (startup topic prevents repetitive announcements)
- Semantic deduplication (skip similar startup messages)
- Natural pacing (intelligent pauses during rapid progress)

v2.0 CHANGE: Now delegates to UnifiedVoiceOrchestrator instead of spawning
its own `say` processes. This prevents the "multiple voices" issue where
concurrent narrator systems would speak simultaneously.

Features:
- Phase-aware narration with smart batching
- Adaptive timing based on startup speed
- Progress milestone announcements
- Error and recovery narration
- Dynamic message generation (no hardcoding)
- Console and voice output coordination
- User activity awareness
- Parallel execution support
- UNIFIED VOICE COORDINATION (v2.0+)

    Intelligent narrator that provides phase-aware voice feedback during startup.

    - Adaptive timing based on phase duration
    - Milestone announcements
    - Error and recovery handling
    - Parallel execution support
    - UNIFIED VOICE COORDINATION (v2.0)
