# Ironcliw Manual Unlock Solution

## Problem
You wanted Ironcliw to handle manual "unlock my screen" commands while bypassing quiet hours policy restrictions, while still maintaining the context-aware unlock flow for scenarios where the screen is locked and you ask Ironcliw to do something else.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Direct Unlock for Manual Commands
When you explicitly say "unlock my screen", Ironcliw now:
- Bypasses the Context Intelligence policy engine completely
- Uses the direct unlock handler to communicate with the Voice Unlock daemon
- Works 24/7, regardless of quiet hours (10 PM - 7 AM)
- Provides immediate feedback: "I'll unlock your screen right away, Sir."

### 2. Context-Aware Unlock Still Works
When the screen is locked and you ask Ironcliw to do something else (e.g., "open Safari and search for dogs"):
- Ironcliw detects the locked screen through the enhanced context handler
- Provides feedback: "I see your screen is locked. I'll unlock it now by typing in your password so I can [action]."
- Unlocks the screen automatically
- Executes your original command
- Reports success: "I unlocked your screen and [completed action]"

## How It Works

### Modified Files
1. **api/voice_unlock_integration.py**
   - Added direct unlock path for manual "unlock my screen" commands
   - Bypasses Context Intelligence policy engine
   - Uses `direct_unlock_handler_fixed.py` for immediate unlock

2. **api/unified_command_processor.py**
   - Already routes "unlock my screen" to voice unlock handler
   - Classification system recognizes unlock/lock commands

### Command Flow
```
"unlock my screen" → UnifiedCommandProcessor → VoiceUnlockHandler → direct_unlock_handler → WebSocket daemon → Screen unlocks
```

## Testing

### Manual Unlock Test
```bash
# Say or type in Ironcliw:
"unlock my screen"

# Expected: Immediate unlock, works any time of day
```

### Context-Aware Unlock Test
```bash
# Lock your screen first, then say:
"open Safari and search for dogs"

# Expected: 
# 1. "I see your screen is locked. I'll unlock it now..."
# 2. Screen unlocks
# 3. Safari opens and searches for dogs
# 4. "I unlocked your screen, opened Safari, and searched for dogs"
```

## Key Components

### Voice Unlock Daemon (Port 8765)
- Handles the actual screen unlock using AppleScript
- No policy restrictions - executes commands as received
- Started automatically with Ironcliw

### Direct Unlock Handler
- `api/direct_unlock_handler_fixed.py`
- Communicates directly with WebSocket daemon
- Bypasses all policy checks

### Enhanced Context Handler
- `api/simple_context_handler_enhanced.py`
- Handles the context-aware unlock scenario
- Provides step-by-step feedback

## Troubleshooting

If manual unlock doesn't work:
1. Check Voice Unlock daemon is running: `ps aux | grep 8765`
2. Ensure password is stored: Run `enable_screen_unlock.sh`
3. Check Ironcliw logs: `tail -f /tmp/jarvis.log`

## Summary
You now have both:
- **Manual control**: "unlock my screen" works anytime without restrictions
- **Smart automation**: Ironcliw automatically unlocks when needed for other commands

The quiet hours policy no longer affects manual unlock commands!
