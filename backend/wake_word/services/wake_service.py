Wake Word Service
=================

Main service for managing wake word detection and Ironcliw activation.

This module provides the core wake word detection service that orchestrates
audio processing, wake word detection, and activation responses. It manages
the complete lifecycle from audio input to user command processing.

Classes:
    ServiceState: Enumeration of service states
    ActivationEvent: Data class for activation events
    WakeWordService: Main service class
    WakeWordAPI: API wrapper for the service

Example:
    >>> service = WakeWordService()
    >>> await service.start(activation_callback)
    >>> # Service now listening for wake words
    >>> await service.stop()
