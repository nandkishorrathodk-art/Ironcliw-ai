# 🔄 RESTART Ironcliw TO LOAD THE LOCK FIX

## The Problem
Ironcliw has been running since 3:28 AM and hasn't loaded the updated code that fixes the lock command.

## The Solution is Already Implemented
✅ The code is fixed and working
✅ Lock commands now fall back to Context Intelligence when Voice Unlock isn't available
✅ Tests confirm it works

## You Just Need to Restart Ironcliw

### Option 1: Quick Restart
```bash
# Kill the current Ironcliw process
pkill -f "python main.py"

# Start Ironcliw again
cd ~/Documents/repos/Ironcliw-AI-Agent/backend
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Graceful Restart
1. Say "Hey Ironcliw, goodbye" or "Ironcliw, shut down"
2. Wait for it to shut down
3. Start it again with `python main.py`

## After Restart

Try saying "lock my screen" and it should work! You'll get one of these responses:

- If Voice Unlock is connected: "Locking your screen now, Sir."
- If Voice Unlock is NOT connected: "Screen locked successfully, Sir."

Either way, your screen will lock successfully!

## Why This Happened

1. You had Ironcliw running since early morning
2. We made code changes to fix the lock command
3. Ironcliw was still using the old code
4. A restart loads the new code with the fix

The Context Intelligence System is ready and working - you just need to restart Ironcliw to use it!
