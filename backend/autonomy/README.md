# Ironcliw Autonomous System

## Overview

The Ironcliw Autonomous System transforms Ironcliw from a reactive assistant into a proactive digital agent that can see, understand, decide, and act independently across your entire digital workspace. This achieves true Iron Man-level Ironcliw capabilities.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Autonomous Decision Making**
- Analyzes your workspace in real-time
- Makes intelligent decisions without asking
- Learns from your preferences and feedback
- Handles routine tasks automatically

### 2. **Smart Permission Management**
- Learns what you approve/deny over time
- Auto-approves high-confidence routine actions
- Always asks for sensitive operations
- Respects quiet hours and user context

### 3. **Context-Aware Behavior**
- Understands when you're focused vs available
- Detects meetings and adjusts behavior
- Monitors activity patterns
- Times actions appropriately

### 4. **Intelligent Action Execution**
- Handles notifications across all apps
- Prepares workspace for meetings
- Organizes windows for productivity
- Manages distractions automatically

## 🎯 Usage

### Voice Commands

Enable autonomous mode:
```
"Hey Ironcliw, enable autonomous mode"
"Hey Ironcliw, activate automatic mode"
```

Check status:
```
"Hey Ironcliw, what's your autonomous status?"
"Hey Ironcliw, show permission statistics"
```

Manage actions:
```
"Hey Ironcliw, rollback last action"
"Hey Ironcliw, disable autonomous mode"
```

### Example Autonomous Actions

1. **Notification Management**
   - Detects "Discord (5 new messages)"
   - Automatically marks as read if you typically ignore Discord
   - Or focuses Discord if you usually respond immediately

2. **Meeting Preparation**
   - Detects "Meeting starts in 5 minutes"
   - Automatically hides sensitive windows (1Password, banking)
   - Opens meeting app and enables Do Not Disturb

3. **Workspace Organization**
   - Detects cluttered workspace (20+ windows)
   - Groups windows by project
   - Minimizes distractions during focus time

4. **Security Protection**
   - Detects sensitive content visible
   - Immediately hides sensitive windows
   - Alerts you to security concerns

## 🧠 How It Works

### Decision Flow

1. **Monitor** - Continuously analyzes workspace state
2. **Detect** - Identifies actionable situations dynamically
3. **Context** - Checks if timing is appropriate
4. **Permission** - Verifies if action is permitted
5. **Execute** - Performs the action safely
6. **Learn** - Records outcome for future decisions

### Learning System

The system learns from:
- Your approval/denial patterns
- Time of day preferences
- Context-specific decisions
- Success/failure of actions

After ~5 decisions of the same type, Ironcliw can start auto-approving or auto-denying similar actions.

## 🔧 Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AutonomousDecisionEngine** (`autonomous_decision_engine.py`)
   - Makes intelligent decisions based on workspace state
   - No hardcoding - uses pattern matching
   - Learns from feedback

2. **PermissionManager** (`permission_manager.py`)
   - Manages and learns permissions
   - Tracks approval patterns
   - Enforces safety rules

3. **ContextEngine** (`context_engine.py`)
   - Understands user state (focused, available, in meeting)
   - Calculates interruption scores
   - Determines action timing

4. **ActionExecutor** (`action_executor.py`)
   - Executes actions safely
   - Provides rollback capabilities
   - Handles errors gracefully

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Built-in Protections

- **Permission Learning** - Learns what you approve/deny
- **Confidence Thresholds** - Only acts on high-confidence decisions
- **Category Rules** - Security actions always require permission
- **Quiet Hours** - Respects your focus time
- **Rollback** - Can undo recent actions
- **Limits** - Won't close too many windows at once

### Override Controls

- Disable autonomous mode anytime
- Rollback recent actions
- View all permissions and stats
- Adjust confidence thresholds

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Execution Statistics
```python
stats = jarvis.action_executor.get_execution_stats()
# Returns: total_executions, success_rate, action_stats
```

### Permission Statistics
```python
perm_stats = jarvis.permission_manager.get_permission_stats()
# Returns: total_decisions, auto_approval_candidates
```

### Context Analysis
```python
context = await jarvis.context_engine.analyze_context(state, windows)
# Returns: user_state, interruption_score, activity_score
```

## 🔄 Integration

The autonomous system integrates seamlessly with:
- Existing vision system for screen understanding
- Voice commands for control
- System controller for action execution
- Claude AI for intelligent decision-making

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Enable Autonomous Mode**
   ```
   "Hey Ironcliw, enable autonomous mode"
   ```

2. **Let Ironcliw Learn**
   - Use Ironcliw normally
   - It will ask permission for new actions
   - Your decisions train the system

3. **Monitor Progress**
   ```
   "Hey Ironcliw, what's your autonomous status?"
   ```

4. **Adjust as Needed**
   - Rollback unwanted actions
   - Disable if needed
   - Check permission stats

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Start Gradually** - Let Ironcliw learn your preferences over time
2. **Review Permissions** - Check what's being auto-approved
3. **Use Feedback** - Tell Ironcliw when actions are wrong
4. **Monitor Activity** - Review execution statistics regularly
5. **Customize Rules** - Adjust thresholds for your workflow

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux)
- Mobile device integration
- Cloud sync for preferences
- Advanced workflow automation
- Natural language rule creation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Ironcliw not taking actions
- Check if autonomous mode is enabled
- Verify monitoring is active
- Review permission denials

### Too many interruptions
- Adjust confidence thresholds
- Set quiet hours
- Review context settings

### Wrong actions taken
- Use rollback feature
- Provide feedback
- Check permission stats

## 📝 Example Scenarios
