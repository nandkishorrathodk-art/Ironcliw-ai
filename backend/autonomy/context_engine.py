"""Context Engine for Ironcliw Autonomous System.

This module provides intelligent context awareness for the Ironcliw autonomous system,
analyzing user behavior patterns, application usage, and environmental factors to
determine appropriate timing for autonomous actions. It prevents interruptions
during focused work and identifies optimal moments for system interventions.

The context engine tracks user activity patterns, detects meeting states, monitors
application focus, and provides recommendations for action timing based on learned
behavioral patterns and real-time analysis.

Example:
    >>> engine = ContextEngine()
    >>> context = await engine.analyze_context(workspace_state, windows)
    >>> should_act, reason = engine.should_act_now(action, context)
