Autonomous Action Queue System for Ironcliw

This module provides a priority-based queue system for managing autonomous actions
with safety controls, retry logic, and comprehensive monitoring. The queue processes
actions based on dynamic priority scoring that considers factors like urgency,
confidence, age, and category importance.

The system supports:
- Priority-based action execution
- Concurrent action processing with limits
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Permission management integration
- Real-time queue monitoring and statistics
- Configurable safety controls

Example:
    >>> from autonomy.action_queue import action_queue
    >>> action = AutonomousAction(...)
    >>> await action_queue.add_action(action)
    >>> state = action_queue.get_queue_state()
