Advanced Contextual Understanding Module for JARVIS

This module provides deep emotional intelligence and adaptive personality capabilities
for JARVIS, enabling sophisticated understanding of user context, emotional states,
and behavioral patterns. It uses machine learning and AI to analyze user behavior
and adapt JARVIS's personality and responses accordingly.

The module includes:
- Emotional state detection and tracking
- Cognitive load assessment
- Work context understanding
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Adaptive personality modeling
- Contextual insight generation

Example:
    >>> engine = ContextualUnderstandingEngine(api_key="your_key")
    >>> state = await engine.analyze_user_state(workspace_data, activity_data)
    >>> response = await engine.generate_empathetic_response("I'm stressed", state)
