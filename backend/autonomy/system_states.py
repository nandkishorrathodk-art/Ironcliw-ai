"""
System States and Transitions for Ironcliw Autonomous System

This module manages the overall state machine for autonomous operations, providing
a comprehensive framework for tracking system states, component health, and state
transitions. It includes timeout handling, callback mechanisms, and health monitoring
for all system components.

The state machine follows a hierarchical approach where the system has an overall
state (SystemState) and individual components have their own states (ComponentState).
State transitions are validated and logged for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Example:
    >>> from autonomy.system_states import state_manager
    >>> await state_manager.initialize_system()
    >>> await state_manager.start_monitoring()
    >>> status = state_manager.get_system_status()
