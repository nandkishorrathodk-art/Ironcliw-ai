Comprehensive Voice Integration System for JARVIS

This module provides intelligent voice announcements, natural conversation capabilities,
and voice-based approval systems for the JARVIS AI assistant. It integrates with
Claude API for dynamic natural language generation and supports multiple voice
interaction types including announcements, conversations, and approval requests.

The system features:
- Dynamic announcement generation with context awareness
- Natural conversational AI with memory and context
- Voice-based approval workflows for autonomous actions
- Intelligent model selection for optimal response generation
- Integration with JARVIS core systems (notifications, decisions, monitoring)

Example:
    >>> voice_system = VoiceIntegrationSystem(api_key="your_api_key")
    >>> await voice_system.start_voice_integration()
    >>> response = await voice_system.process_voice_command("What's my schedule?")
    >>> await voice_system.stop_voice_integration()

Urgency level: {announcement.urgency}
Current context: {context_info}

Requirements:
1. Be concise and natural (1-2 sentences)
2. Match the urgency level in tone
3. Use "Sir" appropriately but not excessively
4. Make it sound conversational, not robotic
5. Include relevant context if it helps

Examples:
- High urgency: "Sir, urgent notification from Slack. The deployment is failing and requires immediate attention."
- Medium urgency: "You have a meeting reminder. The team sync starts in 10 minutes."
- Low urgency: "New message in the general channel when you have a moment."
