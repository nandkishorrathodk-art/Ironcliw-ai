"""Memory management module for the backend application.

This module provides memory-related functionality and utilities for the backend
system. It serves as the entry point for memory management components including
caching, data storage, and memory optimization features.

Components:
- ExperienceRecorder: Black Box for Ironcliw Data Flywheel (RLHF training)
- Experience Types: Data models for interaction recording

The module exposes key memory management classes and functions that can be
imported and used throughout the application for efficient memory handling
and data persistence.
