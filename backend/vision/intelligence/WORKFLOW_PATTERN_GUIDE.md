# Workflow Pattern Engine Guide

## Overview

The Workflow Pattern Engine is a sophisticated component of the Ironcliw Vision Intelligence System that learns, optimizes, and automates user work patterns. It uses dynamic pattern discovery with zero hardcoding to understand how users work and suggest improvements.

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Pattern Learning
- **Sequence Mining**: Discovers frequent action sequences using FP-Growth algorithm
- **Pattern Clustering**: Groups similar workflows using DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering
- **Temporal Analysis**: Understands time-based patterns and routines
- **Variation Tolerance**: Recognizes patterns even with minor variations

### 2. Pattern Types
- **Daily Routines**: Morning startup, email checking, end-of-day workflows
- **Task Patterns**: Debug cycles, document reviews, code-test-commit sequences
- **Problem-Solving Patterns**: Error research, solution testing, documentation lookup
- **Context Switch Patterns**: How users transition between tasks
- **Adaptive Patterns**: Patterns that change based on context

### 3. Advanced Capabilities
- **Pattern Optimization**: Removes redundancies and suggests parallel execution
- **Workflow Automation**: Generates automation scripts for repetitive patterns
- **Predictive Assistance**: Predicts next actions with confidence scores
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors pattern execution success rates

## Architecture

### Memory Allocation (120MB Total)

1. **Pattern Database (60MB)**
   - Stores discovered patterns

## Configuration

```bash
# Enable workflow pattern learning
export WORKFLOW_PATTERN_ENABLED=true

# Set minimum pattern support (0.0-1.0)
export WORKFLOW_MIN_SUPPORT=0.2

# Maximum pattern length
export WORKFLOW_MAX_PATTERN_LENGTH=20

# Enable automation suggestions
export WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION_ENABLED=true

# Pattern clustering method (dbscan, hierarchical, hybrid)
export WORKFLOW_CLUSTERING_METHOD=hybrid
```

## API Usage

### Recording Workflow Events

```python
from workflow_pattern_engine import WorkflowEvent, get_workflow_pattern_engine

engine = get_workflow_pattern_engine()

# Record an event
event = WorkflowEvent(
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    event_type='app_launch',
    source_system='system',
    event_data={'app': 'vscode'}
)
await engine.record_event(event)
```

### Mining Patterns

```python
# Mine patterns with minimum support
patterns = await engine.mine_patterns(min_support=0.2)

for pattern in patterns:
    print(f"Pattern: {' → '.join(pattern.action_sequence)}")
    print(f"Frequency: {pattern.frequency}, Confidence: {pattern.confidence}")
```

### Predicting Next Actions

```python
# Get predictions for current sequence
current_sequence = ['open_file', 'edit_code', 'save_file']
predictions = await engine.predict_next_actions(current_sequence, top_k=5)

for action, probability in predictions:
    print(f"Next action: {action} (probability: {probability:.2f})")
```

### Getting Automation Suggestions

```python
# Get automation suggestions for current context
context = {
    'active_app': 'vscode',
    'recent_actions': ['edit_code', 'test_code'],
    'time_of_day': 'afternoon'
}

suggestions = engine.suggest_automation(context)
for suggestion in suggestions:
    print(f"Automate: {suggestion['description']}")
    print(f"Time saved: {suggestion['estimated_time_saved']}s")
```

## Pattern Examples

### 1. Development Workflow
```
Pattern: open_vscode → open_file → edit_code → save_file → switch_terminal → run_test → switch_vscode → fix_error → save_file → git_commit
Type: TASK_PATTERN
Frequency: 47
Confidence: 0.92
```

### 2. Morning Routine
```
Pattern: system_wake → check_email → check_slack → review_calendar → start_deep_work
Type: ROUTINE_PATTERN
Frequency: 23
Confidence: 0.85
Time Constraint: 8:00 AM - 9:30 AM
```

### 3. Debug Cycle
```
Pattern: error_detected → search_stackoverflow → try_solution → test_code → [repeat]
Type: PROBLEM_SOLVING_PATTERN
Variations: 12
Confidence: 0.78
```

## Advanced Features

### Pattern Optimization

The engine automatically optimizes discovered patterns:
- Removes redundant actions (e.g., duplicate saves)
- Identifies parallelizable actions
- Reorders for efficiency while maintaining dependencies

### Clustering and Similarity

Uses advanced algorithms to group similar patterns:
