# Voice System Improvements

This update significantly improves Ironcliw's voice activation reliability and responsiveness, especially in noisy environments.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Lowered Detection Thresholds**
- Wake word threshold: 0.85 → 0.55
- Confidence threshold: 0.7 → 0.6
- More responsive to "Hey Jarvis" commands

### 2. **Adaptive Noise Handling**
- Automatically adjusts thresholds based on environment
- Works better in noisy conditions
- Maintains accuracy in quiet environments

### 3. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**
- Uses WebRTC VAD to detect speech vs silence
- Reduces false positives from background noise
- Processes only speech segments for efficiency

### 4. **Audio Buffering**
- 3-second rolling buffer captures context
- Wake word buffer preserves 0.5s before + 2.5s after detection
- Prevents missing wake words at buffer boundaries

### 5. **Streaming Processing**
- Real-time audio chunk processing
- Lower latency detection
- Memory-efficient operation

### 6. **Picovoice Integration (Optional)**
- Ultra-fast on-device wake word detection
- ~10ms latency
- Minimal CPU usage (~1-2%)
- Works offline

### 7. **Fully Configurable**
- All thresholds and settings in `config.py`
- Environment variable overrides
- No hardcoded values

## Installation

### Basic Setup (Improved ML Detection)
```bash
pip install webrtcvad
```

### Advanced Setup (With Picovoice)
```bash
pip install -r voice/requirements_voice_improvements.txt

# Get free Picovoice key from https://console.picovoice.ai/
export PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY="your-key-here"
```

## Configuration

Edit `voice/config.py` or set environment variables:

```python
# Key settings
wake_word_threshold_default = 0.55  # Lower = more sensitive
enable_vad = True                   # Voice activity detection
enable_streaming = True             # Streaming mode
use_picovoice = True               # Enable Picovoice (if installed)
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
export WAKE_WORD_THRESHOLD=0.5      # Make even more sensitive
export CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.6
export ENABLE_VAD=true
export PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY="..."   # For Picovoice
```

## Usage

The improvements are integrated into the existing `MLEnhancedVoiceSystem`. No code changes needed:

```python
# System automatically uses best available method
system = MLEnhancedVoiceSystem(api_key)
await system.start()

# For streaming mode
while True:
    audio_chunk = get_audio_chunk()  # Your audio source
    result = await system.process_audio_stream(audio_chunk)
    if result:
        is_wake_word, confidence = result
        print(f"Wake word detected with confidence {confidence}")
```

## Performance Tips

### For 16GB MacBook Pro

1. **Use Picovoice** - Extremely lightweight
2. **Enable streaming** - Processes audio in chunks
3. **Adjust VAD aggressiveness** - Higher = more selective
4. **Lower model cache size** if needed

### Tuning for Your Environment

**Quiet Room:**
- Keep default settings
- Maybe increase threshold slightly for fewer false positives

**Noisy Environment:**
- Lower thresholds further (0.5 or 0.45)
- Increase VAD aggressiveness
- Enable adaptive thresholds

**Mixed Environments:**
- Use default adaptive system
- It auto-adjusts based on noise level

## Troubleshooting

### Still Missing Wake Words?
1. Lower `wake_word_threshold_default` to 0.5 or 0.45
2. Check microphone gain/position
3. Enable debug mode to see detection scores

### Too Many False Positives?
1. Increase thresholds slightly
2. Enable Picovoice for pre-filtering
3. Train personalized model with feedback

### High CPU Usage?
1. Enable Picovoice (uses ~1-2% CPU)
2. Reduce `audio_buffer_duration`
3. Increase `stream_chunk_duration_ms`

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
python -m voice.ml_enhanced_voice_system
```

This will simulate various scenarios and show performance metrics.

## Next Steps

1. **Collect Feedback**: System learns from corrections
2. **Personalize**: Adapts to your voice over time
3. **Fine-tune**: Adjust config based on your environment

The system will continue to improve with use!
