"""
Intelligent Retry Manager - Adaptive Retry Strategy Based on Failure Cause.
============================================================================

Provides intelligent retry logic that adapts based on WHY authentication
failed, not just that it failed. Enables smarter recovery suggestions.

Features:
1. Failure cause analysis (noise, mic change, voice different, security)
2. Adaptive retry strategies per cause
3. Progressive guidance for users
4. Microphone adaptation learning
5. Environment-specific adjustments
6. Smart timeout handling

Per CLAUDE.md:
    "I'm having trouble hearing you clearly - there's some background
    noise. Could you try again, maybe speak a bit louder and closer
    to the microphone?"
