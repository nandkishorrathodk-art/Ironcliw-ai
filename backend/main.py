# Other modules (whisper_audio_fix) use wait_for_numba() which BLOCKS until done
#
# v7.0 also adds module-level initialization in whisper_audio_fix.py so that
# by the time any ThreadPoolExecutor worker tries to import whisper, numba is
# already fully initialized in sys.modules with all submodules loaded.
