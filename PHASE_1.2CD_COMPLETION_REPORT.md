## 🎯 **Key Capabilities**

### **1. Proximity-Aware Command Routing**

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/proximity-display/route-command?command=show%20me%20the%20errors"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "target_display": {
    "display_id": 23,
    "name": "Living Room TV"
  },
  "voice_response": "Sir, I detect you're near the Living Room TV (2.3 meters away). Routing to this display.",
  "routing_reason": "Routed to nearest display based on proximity (2.3m away)",
  "proximity_based": true
}
```

**Voice Responses by Zone:**
- **IMMEDIATE (0-1m):** "Sir, I see you're right at the {display}. Processing here."
- **NEAR (1-3m):** "Sir, I detect you're near the {display} ({distance}m away). Routing here."
- **ROOM (3-8m):** "Sir, you're in the {zone} with the {display}. I'll show results here."
- **FAR (8-15m):** "Sir, based on your location, routing to nearest display."

### **2. Auto-Connection Manager**

**Manual Connection:**
```bash
# Connect to nearest display (uses proximity)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/proximity-display/connect?mode=extend"

# Connect to specific display
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/proximity-display/connect?display_id=23&mode=mirror"

# Force connection (bypass debouncing)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/proximity-display/connect?display_id=23&force=true"
```

**Auto-Connection Evaluation:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/proximity-display/auto-connect"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "evaluated": true,
  "decision": {
    "display_id": 23,
    "display_name": "Living Room TV",
    "action": "auto_connect",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reason": "You are very close to Living Room TV (1.2m away, near zone). High confidence for automatic connection."
  },
  "action_taken": true,
  "connection_result": {
    "success": true,
    "display_id": 23,
    "action": "connect_extend",
    "message": "Success: Extend mode enabled",
    "execution_time": 2.3
  }
}
```

**Disconnect (with User Override):**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/proximity-display/disconnect?display_id=23"
```

Result: Display disconnected + **5-minute cooldown** (prevents auto-reconnect)

### **3. AppleScript Display Automation**

**Backend-Only** (no UI popups):
- ✅ Opens System Preferences in background
- ✅ Toggles Mirror/Extend modes via AppleScript
- ✅ 10-second timeout per operation
- ✅ Async execution (non-blocking)

**Requirements:**
- macOS Accessibility permissions (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility)

**Modes:**
| Mode | Description | AppleScript Action |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `mirror` | Mirror displays | Check "Mirror Displays" checkbox |
| `extend` | Extend displays | Uncheck "Mirror Displays" checkbox |
| `disconnect` | Disconnect display | Log only (physical disconnect required) |

### **4. Debouncing & User Override**

**Debouncing (3s default):**
- Prevents rapid connect/disconnect cycles
- Ensures stable state before next action
- Configurable per-manager instance

**User Override (5 min cooldown):**
- Triggered when user manually disconnects
- Prevents auto-reconnect for 5 minutes
- Respects user intent
- Clears automatically after timeout

**Example:**
```
1. User walks near TV (2m away)
2. Auto-connect triggered → Display extends
3. User manually disconnects via API
4. User override registered (5 min cooldown)
5. User still near TV, but NO auto-reconnect for 5 min
6. After 5 min, auto-reconnect re-enabled
```

| `/routing-stats` | GET | Get command routing statistics |

### **Phase 1D Endpoints:**

## 🧪 **Testing & Verification**

### **Component Tests:**
```bash
# Test imports and initialization
cd backend
python3 -c "
from proximity.auto_connection_manager import AutoConnectionManager
from proximity.proximity_command_router import ProximityCommandRouter

router = ProximityCommandRouter()

print('✅ Phase 1C + 1D components working!')
"
```

**Result:** ✅ All components load successfully

## 🎓 **Real-World Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Walking to Living Room**

```
1. You walk within 2m of Living Room TV with Apple Watch
2. Bluetooth scan detects watch: RSSI = -55 dBm
3. Distance calculated: 2.1 meters
4. Proximity zone: NEAR
5. Proximity score for TV: 0.85 (high)

Auto-Connection Decision:
  Action: PROMPT_USER
  Confidence: 0.75
  Reason: "Near Living Room TV (2.1m away)"

You ask: "Show me my calendar"

Command Routing:
  Target: Living Room TV (display 23)
  Voice Response: "Sir, I detect you're near the Living Room TV (2.1 meters away). Routing to this display."
  
Manual Connection (if desired):
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/proximity-display/connect?display_id=23&mode=extend"
  
Result:
  ✅ Display extends to TV
  ✅ Calendar shows on TV
  ✅ Connection logged
```

### **Example 2: Very Close to Display**

```
1. You sit directly in front of TV (< 1m)
2. RSSI = -45 dBm (strong signal)
3. Distance: 0.8 meters
4. Proximity zone: IMMEDIATE
5. Proximity score: 0.95 (very high)

Auto-Connection Decision:
  Action: AUTO_CONNECT
  Confidence: 0.9
  Reason: "Very close to Living Room TV (0.8m away, immediate zone)"

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/proximity-display/auto-connect"

Result:
  ✅ Automatic connection triggered
  ✅ Display extends to TV
  ✅ Voice: "Sir, I see you're right at the Living Room TV. Processing here."
```

### **Example 3: User Override Scenario**

```
1. Auto-connected to TV
2. User manually disconnects:
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/proximity-display/disconnect?display_id=23"
   
3. User override registered (5 min cooldown)
4. User still near TV (2m away)
5. Auto-connection evaluates but SKIPS (respects user intent)
6. Logs: "[AUTO-CONNECT] User override active for display 23, skipping"
7. After 5 minutes → auto-reconnect re-enabled
```
