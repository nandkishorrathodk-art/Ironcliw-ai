# Ironcliw AI Agent Changelog

## v3.8.0 - Async Vision & Timeout Protection (2025-11-26)

### 🛡️ Major Stability Improvements

This release fixes critical blocking issues that could cause Ironcliw to hang indefinitely when processing vision queries like "can you see my screen?" or "what's happening across my workspaces?"

#### ✅ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: "Can you see my screen?" queries no longer hang indefinitely
- **Fixed**: Multi-space Yabai queries now complete within timeout
- **Fixed**: PyAutoGUI blocking operations no longer freeze the event loop
- **Fixed**: Claude API timeouts now return graceful error messages

#### 🔧 New Features

- **ThreadPoolExecutor Integration**
  - All blocking PyAutoGUI operations now run in background threads
  - Screen capture, mouse clicks, and typing are now non-blocking
  - Prevents UI freezes during computer use operations

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
  - API calls protected by circuit breaker (3 failures = open)
  - Auto-recovery after 60 seconds
  - Graceful degradation when Claude API is unavailable
  - Prevents cascading failures during outages

- **Comprehensive Timeout Protection**
  - Overall command timeout: 45 seconds
  - Claude API calls: 30 seconds
  - Screen capture: 10 seconds
  - Action execution: 10 seconds
  - Yabai subprocess calls: 5 seconds

- **Async Yabai Support**
  - New `enumerate_all_spaces_async()` method
  - New `describe_workspace_async()` method
  - New `get_workspace_summary_async()` method
  - Subprocess calls run in thread pool with timeout

#### 📁 Files Changed
- `backend/display/computer_use_connector.py` - Added `run_blocking()`, `CircuitBreaker`, async `ScreenCaptureHandler` and `ActionExecutor`
- `backend/api/vision_command_handler.py` - Added overall timeout wrapper
- `backend/api/pure_vision_intelligence.py` - Added `VisionCircuitBreaker`, timeout on API calls
- `backend/vision/yabai_space_detector.py` - Added `run_subprocess_async()` and async methods
- `backend/vision/intelligent_vision_router.py` - Updated `_execute_yabai()` with async support

#### 📊 Performance Impact
- Vision queries now guaranteed to complete or timeout (max 45s)
- No more indefinite hangs on slow API responses
- Improved responsiveness during high load
- Better error messages for timeout conditions
