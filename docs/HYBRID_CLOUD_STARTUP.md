# Hybrid Cloud Startup Flow

## Overview

Ironcliw uses a **hybrid cloud intelligence architecture** to prevent memory exhaustion on local macOS (16GB RAM) by automatically offloading heavy components to GCP Spot VMs (32GB RAM) when memory pressure is detected.

This ensures Ironcliw can run in **full mode** with all features, while preventing local memory thrashing and OOM conditions.

## Architecture

### Local macOS (16GB RAM)
- **CRITICAL priority components** (authentication, screen lock detection)
- Minimal overhead, fast startup
- Handles core security and UI interactions

### GCP Spot VM (32GB RAM)
- **MEDIUM/LOW/DEFERRED priority components** (ML models, heavy processing)
- Auto-created when RAM ≥ 80%
- Cost-optimized: $0.029/hour with daily budget tracking
- Instance type: `e2-highmem-4` (4 vCPU, 32GB RAM)

## Startup Flow

### 1. Component Warmup Initialization

```
[START] Component warmup begins
   ↓
[CHECK] Current memory usage: X%
```

### 2. Memory Pressure Detection

**If RAM < 80%:**
```
[NORMAL] Load all registered components locally
   ↓
[COMPLETE] Warmup finished
```

**If RAM ≥ 80%:**
```
[ALERT] ⚠️  High memory pressure detected!
   ↓
[ACTIVATE] Hybrid cloud intelligence
```

### 3. Hybrid Cloud Activation (RAM ≥ 80%)

```
[ANALYZE] Get detailed memory snapshot
   │
   ├─ macOS: pressure level (normal/warn/critical)
   ├─ macOS: page outs (swapping activity)
   ├─ Linux: PSI metrics (process stalls)
   └─ Platform: available memory, reclaimable cache
   ↓
[SPLIT] Separate components by priority
   │
   ├─ CRITICAL components → Load locally
   └─ MEDIUM/LOW/DEFERRED → Offload candidates
   ↓
[DECIDE] Consult intelligent optimizer
   │
   ├─ Check daily budget remaining
   ├─ Check VM creation quotas
   ├─ Analyze workload patterns
   ├─ Calculate pressure score (0-100)
   └─ Predict if VM will be useful
   ↓
```

**If optimizer recommends VM:**
```
[CREATE] Spin up GCP Spot VM
   │
   ├─ Instance: e2-highmem-4 (32GB RAM)
   ├─ Cost: $0.029/hour
   ├─ Zone: us-central1-a
   └─ Timeout: 300s for creation
   ↓
[SUCCESS] VM created at IP: X.X.X.X
   │
   ├─ Record in cost tracker
   ├─ Track uptime and costs
   └─ Enable health monitoring
   ↓
[LOAD] Critical components locally
[OFFLOAD] Heavy components to VM (future: via API)
   ↓
[COMPLETE] Hybrid mode active
```

**If optimizer denies VM:**
```
[DENY] VM creation not recommended
   │
   ├─ Reason: Budget exhausted / quota limit / workload too short
   └─ Fallback to critical-only loading
   ↓
[FALLBACK] Load only CRITICAL components locally
   ↓
[COMPLETE] Minimal mode (graceful degradation)
```

## Component Priority Levels

| Priority | When Loaded | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Always local | Screen lock detection, voice authentication |
| **HIGH** | Local if RAM < 80% | Context handlers, NLP processors |
| **MEDIUM** | Offload if RAM ≥ 80% | Vision systems, learning databases |
| **LOW** | Offload if RAM ≥ 80% | Analytics, telemetry |
| **DEFERRED** | Never auto-loaded | Heavy ML models, experimental features |

## Intelligent Decision-Making

The `IntelligentGCPOptimizer` uses multi-factor analysis to prevent unnecessary VM creation:

### Pressure Scoring (0-100)

**Factors:**
- Memory pressure score (35% weight)
- Swap activity score (25% weight)
- Trend analysis (15% weight)
- Predicted pressure in 60s (15% weight)
- Time of day patterns (5% weight)
- Historical stability (5% weight)

**Thresholds:**
- 60-79: Warning (consider GCP)
- 80-94: Critical (recommend GCP)
- 95-100: Emergency (urgent GCP)

### Cost Protection

- Daily budget limit: $1.00 (configurable)
- Max VM creations per day: 10
- Prevents VM churn: 5-minute cooldown after destruction
- Tracks actual vs estimated costs
- Learns from historical VM sessions

### Workload Detection

- **Coding spike**: Short-term RAM increase (no VM needed)
- **ML training**: Sustained high usage (VM recommended)
- **Browser heavy**: Cache pressure (local can handle)
- **Sustained load**: Persistent high RAM (VM recommended)

## Integration Points

### 1. Component Warmup System
**File:** `backend/core/component_warmup.py`

```python
async def warmup_all(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Check memory
    mem_percent = psutil.virtual_memory().percent

    if mem_percent >= 80:
        # Activate hybrid cloud
        memory_snapshot = await memory_monitor.get_memory_pressure()
        vm_instance = await create_vm_if_needed(
            memory_snapshot=memory_snapshot,
            components=offloadable_components,
            trigger_reason="High memory pressure during warmup"
        )
```

### 2. Platform Memory Monitor
**File:** `backend/core/platform_memory_monitor.py`

- macOS: `memory_pressure` command + `vm_stat` page outs
- Linux: PSI (Pressure Stall Information) + `/proc/meminfo`
- Distinguishes cache vs actual pressure

### 3. GCP VM Manager
**File:** `backend/core/gcp_vm_manager.py`

- Creates/monitors/terminates Spot VMs
- Integrates with Google Cloud Compute Engine API
- Health checks every 30 seconds
- Auto-cleanup after 3 hours max lifetime

### 4. Intelligent Optimizer
**File:** `backend/core/intelligent_gcp_optimizer.py`

- Multi-factor pressure analysis
- Budget tracking and enforcement
- Workload pattern detection
- VM creation locking (prevents duplicates)

---

## Troubleshooting

### VM Creation Fails
**Symptom:** "Could not create GCP VM"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Daily budget exhausted → Wait until next day or increase budget
2. GCP quota limits → Request quota increase in GCP Console
3. API not enabled → Enable Compute Engine API
4. Auth issues → Check GCP credentials in environment

### Components Stuck in PENDING
**Symptom:** Components never reach READY state

**Possible Causes:**
1. Timeout too short → Increase component timeout
2. Dependency not met → Check dependency graph
3. Import error → Verify component module exists
4. Memory pressure → VM creation may have failed

### Unexpectedly High Costs
**Symptom:** GCP costs higher than expected

**Possible Causes:**
1. VM not auto-terminated → Check max lifetime setting
2. Multiple VMs created → Check VM creation locking
3. Long-running workload → Adjust workload detection
4. Budget not enforced → Verify budget file exists

## Summary

Ironcliw's hybrid cloud startup flow prevents local memory exhaustion by:

1. **Detecting** memory pressure ≥80% during component warmup
2. **Analyzing** pressure with platform-specific metrics (macOS/Linux)
3. **Deciding** whether to create GCP VM using intelligent optimizer
4. **Creating** cost-optimized Spot VM (32GB, $0.029/hour) if recommended
5. **Splitting** components: CRITICAL local, MEDIUM/LOW/DEFERRED offloadable
6. **Tracking** costs and usage with daily budget enforcement
7. **Monitoring** VM health and auto-cleanup to prevent runaway costs

This ensures **full mode capabilities** while protecting the local macOS from memory thrashing and OOM conditions.
