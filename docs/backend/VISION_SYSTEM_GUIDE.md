Detection methods:
- OCR text extraction
- Pattern matching for update keywords
- Red notification badge detection
- UI element analysis

### 2. Screen Context Understanding

Provides information about:
- Open applications
- Visible text content
- UI element positions
- Notification badges
- System status indicators

### 3. Claude Vision Integration

When Claude API is available:
- Advanced image understanding
- Natural language descriptions
- Activity context analysis
- Security threat detection
- Intelligent suggestions

### 4. Continuous Monitoring

- Background monitoring for updates
- Configurable check intervals
- Priority-based notifications
- Automatic Ironcliw announcements

## Use Cases

### 1. Update Management
```
User: "Hey Ironcliw, check if I need to update anything"
Ironcliw: "Sir, I've detected 3 updates: macOS 14.2, Chrome browser, and Slack. 
         The macOS update is marked as a critical security update."
```

### 2. Productivity Assistant
```
User: "Hey Ironcliw, what am I working on?"
Ironcliw: "I can see you have VS Code open with a Python file, Chrome with 
         documentation tabs, and Terminal running tests. You appear to be 
         debugging the authentication module."
```

### 3. Security Monitoring
```
User: "Hey Ironcliw, start monitoring for security alerts"
Ironcliw: "I'll monitor your screen for security notifications and alert you 
         immediately if any appear, sir."
```

### 4. Accessibility
```
User: "Hey Ironcliw, read the error message on screen"
Ironcliw: "The error message says: 'Connection timeout: Unable to reach server. 
         Please check your internet connection and try again.'"
```

## Technical Details

### Screen Capture (macOS)
- Uses Quartz framework for native screen capture
- No external dependencies or permissions needed
- Supports full screen or specific regions
- Hardware-accelerated on Apple Silicon

### Text Extraction
- Tesseract OCR for text recognition
- Pre-processing for better accuracy:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Adaptive thresholding
  - Noise reduction
- Multi-language support (configure in Tesseract)

### Update Detection Algorithm
1. Capture screen or specific regions
2. Extract text using OCR
3. Apply regex patterns for update keywords
4. Detect red notification badges
5. Analyze UI elements for update indicators
6. Cross-reference with known update patterns
7. Classify by urgency and type

### Performance Optimizations
- Async/await for non-blocking operations
- Region-based capture for efficiency
- Caching of recent scans
- Batch processing of text regions
- GPU acceleration where available

### Async Architecture & Timeout Protection (v3.8.0)

The vision system now includes comprehensive async support and timeout protection:

#### ThreadPoolExecutor for Blocking Operations
All blocking operations (PyAutoGUI, subprocess calls) now run in dedicated thread pools:
```python
# Example: Screen capture is now non-blocking
async def capture(self, ...):
    screenshot = await run_blocking(
        self._capture_sync, region,
        timeout=self.capture_timeout
    )
```

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
API calls to Claude are protected by a circuit breaker that:
- Opens after 3 consecutive failures
- Prevents cascading failures during outages
- Auto-recovers after 60 seconds
- Returns graceful fallback responses when open

```python
# Circuit breaker states: closed -> open -> half-open -> closed
if not await self._circuit_breaker.can_execute():
    return fallback_response
```

#### Timeout Protection
All operations have configurable timeouts:
| Operation | Default Timeout | Location |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Overall command | 45s | `vision_command_handler.py` |
| Claude API call | 30s | `pure_vision_intelligence.py` |
| Screen capture | 10s | `computer_use_connector.py` |
| Action execution | 10s | `computer_use_connector.py` |
| Yabai queries | 10s | `intelligent_vision_router.py` |

#### Yabai Async Support
Multi-space workspace detection is now fully async:
```python
# Non-blocking subprocess calls
result = await run_subprocess_async(
    ["yabai", "-m", "query", "--spaces"],
    timeout=5.0
)

# Async workspace description
description = await yabai_detector.describe_workspace_async()
```

This prevents "can you see my screen?" and "what's happening across my workspaces?" queries from hanging indefinitely.

## Privacy & Security

- All processing happens locally
- No screenshots are stored permanently
- No data sent to external services (except Claude API if enabled)
- Only extracted text is processed, not raw images
- User can disable monitoring at any time

## Troubleshooting

### "Vision capabilities are not available"
1. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install Tesseract: `brew install tesseract`
3. Restart Ironcliw

### "No text detected on screen"
1. Ensure good screen contrast
2. Try different screen regions
3. Check Tesseract installation: `tesseract --version`

### "Claude vision not working"
1. Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set
2. Ensure you're using a vision-capable Claude model
3. Check API quota/limits

### "Updates not detected"
1. Ensure update notifications are visible
2. Try manual region selection
3. Check if notifications are in supported languages

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Custom update pattern training
- [ ] Integration with native macOS notification center
- [ ] Screenshot history with searchable text

## Contributing

To add new detection patterns:

1. Edit `screen_vision.py`:
```python
def _initialize_update_patterns(self):
    return {
        "your_app": [
            re.compile(r"Your App.*update pattern", re.I)
        ]
    }
```

2. Add voice command in `jarvis_agent_voice.py`:
```python
self.special_commands["your command"] = "Description"
```

3. Test with: `python test_vision_system.py`
