# Ironcliw M1-Optimized Memory Management System

## Overview

The Ironcliw Memory Management System is a proactive, AI-driven solution designed specifically for M1 MacBooks with 16GB RAM. It prevents crashes and ensures smooth operation by intelligently managing component lifecycles based on real-time memory conditions.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Proactive Memory Monitoring**
- Real-time memory usage tracking with 2-second intervals
- M1 unified memory architecture awareness
- Four memory states: HEALTHY (<70%), WARNING (70-85%), CRITICAL (85-95%), EMERGENCY (>95%)

### 2. **AI-Driven Memory Prediction**
- Historical pattern analysis for accurate memory requirement predictions
- Component-specific memory profiling
- Safety buffers to prevent unexpected spikes

### 3. **Intelligent Component Lifecycle**
- Priority-based component management (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Automatic loading/unloading based on memory availability
- Graceful degradation under memory pressure

### 4. **Emergency Protocols**
- Automatic optimization at WARNING state
- Aggressive cleanup at CRITICAL state
- Emergency shutdown of non-critical components at EMERGENCY state

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Memory Status
- `GET /memory/status` - Current memory state and usage
- `GET /memory/report` - Detailed memory analysis report

### Component Management
- `GET /memory/components` - List all components with status
- `POST /memory/components/register` - Register new component
- `POST /memory/components/{name}/load` - Load component
- `POST /memory/components/{name}/unload` - Unload component

### Memory Control
- `POST /memory/optimize` - Trigger memory optimization
- `POST /memory/emergency-cleanup` - Force emergency cleanup

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Setup

```python
from memory_manager import M1MemoryManager, ComponentPriority

# Create manager instance
memory_manager = M1MemoryManager()

# Register components
memory_manager.register_component("chatbot", ComponentPriority.CRITICAL, 100)
memory_manager.register_component("nlp_engine", ComponentPriority.HIGH, 1500)
memory_manager.register_component("voice_engine", ComponentPriority.MEDIUM, 2000)

# Start monitoring
await memory_manager.start_monitoring()
```

### Loading Components Safely

```python
# Check if component can be loaded
can_load, reason = await memory_manager.can_load_component("nlp_engine")
if can_load:
    # Load your component
    nlp = NLPEngine()
    success = await memory_manager.load_component("nlp_engine", nlp)
else:
    print(f"Cannot load: {reason}")
```

### Memory State Callbacks

```python
async def memory_alert_handler(snapshot):
    if snapshot.state == MemoryState.CRITICAL:
        # Take action when memory is critical
        await notify_user("Memory critical!")
        
memory_manager.add_state_callback(memory_alert_handler)
```

## 📈 Memory Dashboard

Access the real-time memory dashboard at:
```
http://localhost:8000/memory_dashboard.html
```

Features:
- Live memory usage visualization
- Component status tracking
- One-click memory optimization
- Emergency controls

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
cd backend
python test_memory_manager.py
```

Tests include:
- Basic functionality validation
- Memory pressure simulation
- Emergency scenario handling
- Prediction accuracy testing

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### M1 Mac Specifics
- Unified memory architecture means RAM is shared with GPU
- macOS may compress memory, affecting measurements
- Swap usage should be minimized for optimal performance

### Component Priorities
- **CRITICAL**: Core functionality that must always run
- **HIGH**: Important features that should run when possible
- **MEDIUM**: Enhanced features that improve user experience
- **LOW**: Optional features that can be disabled under pressure

### Memory Thresholds
- **70%**: Start optimizing (clear caches, unload unused)
- **85%**: Aggressive cleanup (unload MEDIUM/LOW priority)
- **95%**: Emergency mode (keep only CRITICAL components)

## 🔍 Monitoring Memory Health

Check system health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Response includes:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "memory": {
    "state": "healthy",
    "percent_used": 68.5,
    "available_mb": 5120.0,
    "components_loaded": ["simple_chatbot", "nlp_engine"]
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Register all components** before loading them
2. **Set realistic memory estimates** for better prediction
3. **Use appropriate priorities** based on functionality importance
4. **Handle load failures gracefully** in your application
5. **Monitor memory alerts** and respond appropriately

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### High Memory Usage
1. Check loaded components: `GET /memory/components`
2. Optimize memory: `POST /memory/optimize`
3. Review component priorities

### Component Won't Load
1. Check memory availability: `GET /memory/status`
2. Verify component registration
3. Try unloading other components first

### Frequent Emergency States
1. Reduce component memory estimates
2. Adjust threshold values
3. Consider upgrading system RAM (if possible)

## 📚 Next Steps

With the memory management system in place, you can now safely:
1. Integrate the RAG engine for knowledge retrieval
2. Add advanced NLP capabilities
3. Enable voice processing
4. Eventually integrate GPT-2 or larger models

The memory manager ensures these components won't crash your system!
