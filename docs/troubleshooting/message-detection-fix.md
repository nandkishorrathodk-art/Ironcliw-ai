# Message Detection Fix Documentation

## Issue
When users asked Ironcliw "do I have any messages?", it was being processed as a regular conversation query instead of triggering the Multi-Window Intelligence system.

## Root Cause
The query "do I have any messages" was not being recognized as a system command because:
1. The keyword "messages" was not in the `system_keywords` set
2. Message-related phrases were not in the `vision_phrases` detection

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Keywords (jarvis_agent_voice.py line 112-113)
```python
self.system_keywords = {
    # ... existing keywords ...
    "messages", "errors", "windows", "workspace", "optimize",
    "meeting", "privacy", "sensitive", "productivity"
}
```

### 2. Added Workspace Phrases (jarvis_agent_voice.py line 217-227)
```python
workspace_phrases = [
    "do i have any messages", "any messages", "check messages",
    "do i have messages", "new messages", "unread messages",
    "any errors", "show errors", "what's broken",
    "optimize workspace", "productivity", "what windows",
    "prepare for meeting", "meeting prep", "privacy mode",
    "workflow", "usual setup"
]
```

## How It Works Now

1. User says: "Hey Ironcliw, do I have any messages?"
2. `_is_system_command()` detects this as a workspace intelligence query
3. `_handle_system_command()` routes it to `_handle_workspace_command()`
4. The workspace intelligence system analyzes open windows
5. Ironcliw responds with: "You have Discord and Slack open but no new messages"

## Supported Message Queries
- "Do I have any messages?"
- "Any new messages?"
- "Check my messages"
- "Show me my messages"
- "Any unread messages?"

## Testing
The fix ensures that all workspace intelligence queries are properly detected and routed to the Multi-Window Intelligence system instead of being processed as regular conversation.
