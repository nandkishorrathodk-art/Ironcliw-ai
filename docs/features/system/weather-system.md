# Ironcliw Weather System Documentation

## Overview
The Ironcliw weather system has been enhanced to work in multiple modes, providing clear communication about its capabilities and gracefully degrading when components are unavailable.

## Weather System Modes

### 1. **FULL MODE** (Vision-Enabled Weather Analysis)
**Requirements:**
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable set
- Backend server running (`python main.py`)
- Vision analyzer initialized
- Weather system initialized with vision handler

**How it works:**
1. Opens Weather app
2. Navigates to "My Location - Home" using keyboard/click navigation
3. Uses Claude Vision API to analyze the weather display
4. Provides natural language response with weather details

**User Experience:**
- Ironcliw says: "I'm checking the weather for you using vision analysis. One moment..."
- Then provides detailed weather information read from the screen

### 2. **LIMITED MODE** (No Vision)
**When this happens:**
- No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set
- Vision analyzer not initialized
- Weather system exists but without vision capabilities

**How it works:**
1. Opens Weather app
2. Attempts keyboard navigation to "My Location"
3. Informs user about limited mode

**User Experience:**
- Ironcliw says: "I'm operating in limited mode without vision capabilities. I've opened the Weather app and navigated to your location. To enable full weather analysis with automatic reading, please ensure all Ironcliw components are loaded."

### 3. **BASIC MODE** (Minimal Functionality)
**When this happens:**
- No weather system initialized
- Only basic subprocess commands available

**How it works:**
1. Opens Weather app
2. User must manually navigate

**User Experience:**
- Ironcliw says: "I'm in basic mode. I've opened the Weather app for you. For automatic weather analysis, please ensure the weather system is properly initialized."

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Clear Mode Communication**
- Ironcliw now explicitly tells you which mode it's operating in
- Explains what's missing for full functionality
- Provides actionable steps to enable full mode

### 2. **Navigation Implementation**
Added actual keyboard navigation to select "My Location":
```python
# Navigate to My Location
await controller.key_press('up')     # Go to top
await controller.key_press('up')     # Ensure at top
await controller.key_press('down')   # Select first item
await controller.key_press('return') # Activate
```

### 3. **Graceful Degradation**
- Always attempts to provide some weather functionality
- Falls back through modes: Full → Limited → Basic
- Never fails completely - always opens Weather app

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Comprehensive try/catch blocks
- Detailed logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

## API Response Structure

The weather command now returns additional metadata:

```json
{
    "response": "Weather information...",
    "status": "success|limited|fallback",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "command_type": "weather_vision|weather_limited|weather_fallback",
    "mode": "full_vision|limited_no_vision|error"
}
```

## Testing the System

1. **Test Full Mode:**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
   python main.py
   # In another terminal: "Hey Ironcliw, what's the weather?"
   ```

2. **Test Limited Mode:**
   ```bash
   unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   python main.py
   # Ask for weather - should open app and navigate
   ```

3. **Test Navigation:**
   ```bash
   python test_weather_simple.py
   # Should open Weather and navigate to My Location
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Vision Not Working?
1. Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set
2. Verify vision analyzer initialized in logs
3. Ensure screen capture permissions granted

### Navigation Not Working?
1. Ensure Weather app has locations configured
2. "My Location" should be in the sidebar
3. Check System Events accessibility permissions

### Still Limited Mode?
Check backend logs for:
- "Weather system initialized with vision"
- "Vision analyzer available: True"
- No import errors for vision components

## Future Enhancements
- Cache weather data to reduce API calls
- Support for multiple locations
- Integration with Siri Shortcuts for faster access
- Weather alerts and notifications
