## 🎯 Problems Solved

### 1. Multiple Speakers
**Problem**: System couldn't distinguish between primary user and other voices
**Solution**:
- Voice fingerprinting using spectral features (F0, formants, MFCC-like timbre)
- Primary user enrollment (50 samples for statistical model)
- Continuous learning and profile updates
- Automatic detection and tracking of up to 5 other speakers
- Real-time speaker identification with Mahalanobis-like distance

### 2. TV/Radio Interference
**Problem**: Continuous audio from media triggered false wake words
**Solution**:
- TV/Radio signature detection using:
  - Spectral stability analysis (compressed audio has stable spectrum)
  - Multiple speaker detection (rapid speaker changes)
  - Background music + speech patterns
- Automatic confidence reduction when TV/Radio detected
- Adaptive filtering to isolate primary user voice

### 3. Echo/Reverb
**Problem**: In large rooms or with hard surfaces, audio reflections confused detection
**Solution**:
- Autocorrelation-based echo detection
- Detection of delayed signal copies (1-10ms delays)
- RT60 estimation for room acoustics
- Adaptive filtering to compensate for reverb
- Echo delay tracking and suppression

### 4. Sudden Noise Spikes
**Problem**: Construction, sirens, or loud sounds disrupted recognition
**Solution**:
- Statistical anomaly detection (3σ threshold)
- Running energy buffer with mean/variance tracking
- Immediate suppression when spike detected
- Transient noise history (last 10 seconds)
- Automatic recovery after spike passes

## 📊 Adaptive Algorithms

### Speaker Similarity Calculation

Uses weighted Euclidean distance in feature space:

```javascript
similarity = exp(-totalDistance)

where totalDistance =
  0.25 * |spectralCentroid - μ| / σ +
  0.15 * |spectralRolloff - μ| / σ +
  0.15 * |zeroCrossingRate - μ| / σ +
  0.30 * |fundamentalFrequency - μ| / σ +
  0.10 * energyDistributionDistance +
  0.05 * timbreDistance
```

### Confidence Enhancement

Original confidence from Web Speech API is multiplied by environmental quality:

```javascript
enhancedConfidence = originalConfidence * environmentalQuality

where environmentalQuality =
  1.0 (baseline)
  × 0.7 (if multi-speaker detected)
  × 0.6 (if TV/radio detected)
  × 0.8 (if music detected)
  × 0.9 (if echo detected)
  × SNR_factor (0.5 if SNR < 10 dB, 0.8 if SNR < 20 dB, 1.0 otherwise)
```

### Adaptive Thresholds

All thresholds adapt to environment:

```javascript
// Energy threshold for speech detection
energyThreshold = noiseFloor + (dynamicRange * 0.1)

// Zero-crossing rate threshold
zcrThreshold = 0.3 + (noiseFactor * 0.1)

// Speaker similarity threshold
similarityThreshold = 0.7 + (noiseLevel * 0.1) - (profileStability * 0.1)
```

---

## 🎛️ Processing Parameters

All parameters are **dynamically adjusted** based on environment:

### Noise Gate
```javascript
noiseGate = averageEnergy * 1.5
```
Automatically adapts to room noise level.

### Compression Ratio
```javascript
if (SNR < 10 dB): compressionRatio = 4.0 (heavy)
if (SNR < 20 dB): compressionRatio = 2.0 (moderate)
else:             compressionRatio = 1.0 (none)
```
More compression in noisy environments to reduce dynamic range.

### Filters
```javascript
highPassCutoff = musicDetected ? 100 Hz : 80 Hz
lowPassCutoff = tvRadioDetected ? 4000 Hz : 8000 Hz
```
Adapt filter cutoffs based on detected noise sources.

### Analyser Smoothing
```javascript
smoothingTimeConstant = 0.1 + (spectralStability * 0.4)  // 0.1-0.5
```
More smoothing in stable environments, less in dynamic ones.

## 🔬 Algorithm Details

### Speech Detection

Uses multiple heuristics (weighted vote):

```javascript
speechProbability =
  0.3 * hasEnergy +       // Energy > threshold
  0.2 * hasVoicing +      // ZCR < threshold (voiced speech)
  0.2 * hasSpeechSpectrum + // Centroid in 80-8000 Hz
  0.3 * hasFormants       // At least 2 formants detected

isSpeech = speechProbability ≥ 0.6
```

### Formant Detection

Finds local maxima in frequency spectrum within formant ranges:
- **F1**: 300-900 Hz (vowel height)
- **F2**: 800-2500 Hz (vowel frontness)
- **F3**: 1700-3500 Hz (rounding)

### Fundamental Frequency (F0) Estimation

Uses autocorrelation method:
```javascript
for period in [minPeriod, maxPeriod]:
  correlation = Σ(samples[i] * samples[i + period])
  if correlation > bestCorrelation:
    bestPeriod = period

F0 = sampleRate / bestPeriod
```

Range: 80-500 Hz (typical human voice)

### Music Detection

```javascript
musicProbability =
  0.4 * hasHarmonics +    // Peaks at harmonic intervals
  0.4 * hasRhythm +       // Periodic energy fluctuations
  0.2 * hasWideRange      // Spectral rolloff > 8 kHz

isMusic = musicProbability > 0.6
```

### TV/Radio Detection

```javascript
tvProbability =
  0.3 * isStableSpectrum +    // Spectral stability > 80%
  0.4 * hasMultipleSpeakers + // > 2 other speakers
  0.3 * hasBackgroundMusic    // Music detected

isTV = tvProbability > 0.6
```

### Echo Detection

Uses autocorrelation to find delayed copies:
```javascript
for delay in [1ms, 10ms]:  // Typical room echo delays
  correlation = Σ(samples[i] * samples[i + delay])
  if correlation > 0.3:
    echoDetected = true
    echoDelays.push(delay)
```

## 🔄 Integration with Adaptive Voice Detection

The Environmental Adaptation system integrates seamlessly with the Adaptive Voice Detection system:

```javascript
// In AdaptiveVoiceDetection.js
calculateEnhancedConfidence(result, context) {
  // Get environmental assessment
  const envAssessment = environmentalAdaptation.getEnhancedConfidence(
    confidence,
    transcript
  );

  // Start with environmentally-adjusted confidence
  let enhanced = envAssessment.enhancedConfidence;

  // Add adaptive bonuses
  enhanced += voiceMatchBonus;
  enhanced += familiarityBonus;
  enhanced += predictionBonus;
  enhanced += timeBonus;
  enhanced += streakBonus;
  enhanced += environmentAdjustment;

  return enhanced;
}
```

This creates a **two-tier confidence system**:
1. **Environmental Tier**: Acoustic quality and speaker isolation
2. **Adaptive Tier**: Learning-based pattern recognition
